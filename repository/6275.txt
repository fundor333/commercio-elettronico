#titolo Michelangelo's Madonna - English News
     (ANSA) - TURIN - A Michelangelo masterpiece, one of the most
famous depictions of the Nativity, is on special show in Turin
for the Christmas period. The Madonna with Child will be
displayed in the Medieval courtyard of Palazzo Madama in a free
exhibition open in Turin until February 12. 
   The study, normally housed in Florence's Buonarroti
Foundation, was created in 1525 with ink, black and red chalk
and white lead. 
     The decision to exhibit the Madonna with Child in the
building in the heart of Turin's historic centre is intended to
''highlight the deep symbolic value of this time of year'', said
the municipal authorities. 
   ''Christmas in the Christian tradition marks the birth of
Jesus'', explained Turin Culture Councillor Maurizio
Braccialarghe. ''By displaying this valuable drawing by
Michelangelo we hope to pay tribute to the idea of motherhood''.    Buonarroti Foundation Director Pina Ragionieri commented:
''It is illuminating to think of this piece, unrivalled in the
body of the artist's drawings, as a meditation on a painful
motherhood''. 
   A transparent box has been placed at the entrance to the
Medieval Courtyard with a sign inviting donations in support of
culture. The exhibition was staged with financing from the CRT
Foundation and with assistance from the Rome Metamorphosis
Association and the Casa Buonarroti Foundation of Florence. (ANSA).
