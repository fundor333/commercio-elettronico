#titolo Central and southern Italy experiences tail end of winter - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Rome, March 15 - Large parts of central and
southern Italy were in the grips of heavy rainfall and freezing
temperatures on Friday as winter weather continued to bite.      Traffic disruptions were reported across the southern
Campania region where a landslide also interrupted railway
services between Vietri sul Mare and Cava dei Tirreni north of
Salerno. 
     The Naples fire department received dozens of calls for
assistance particularly due to the flooding of shops and land. 
     Maritime services linking the regional capital to islands
in the Gulf of Naples also experienced disruptions due to rough
seas.      Snow fell in Sardinia's highland Barbagia region, making
driving hazardous.  
     Early Friday a coach carrying 29 high school students and
two teachers from Cagliari to Seui in the province of Ogliastra
went off the road due to snow. 
     No-one was injured in the incident.      Snow was also reported in Sicily, Calabria and Campania.
