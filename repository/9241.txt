#titolo New pope elected - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Rome, March 13 - White smoke billowed out of
the chimney on the Sistine Chapel roof on Wednesday to signal
that the conclave of cardinals had elected a new pope.      The bells of St Peter's rang out in confirmation of
the election and a huge crowd applauded and chanted "Long Live
The Pope, Long Live The Pope".      The pope is the 266th head of the Catholic Church since St
Peter, the first one.      The conclave was very short, taking only five ballots over
less than two days.      Benedict XVI spurred the election with his shock abdication
last month.
