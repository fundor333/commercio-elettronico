#titolo Ex-senator De Gregorio put under house-arrest in Rome - ANSA English

    (ANSA) - Naples, March 15 - Italian financial police
notified ex-senator Sergio De Gregorio on Friday that he has
been put under house-arrest at his home in Rome.      The arrest is for alleged financial crimes related to the
newspaper L'Avanti!, which De Gregorio once ran with a
wheeler-dealer former associate of ex-premier Silvio Berlusconi,
Walter Lavitola.      De Gregorio was informed he faces charges of conspiracy,
fraud against the State, money-laundering and extortion. 
     On Monday, De Gregorio confessed to receiving two million
euros that he did not declare to the taxman.      But he denied that the money was a bribe from Berlusconi to
switch sides from the centre-left to the centre-right to
destabilize Romano Prodi's 2006-2008 government.      Berlusconi is under investigation in relation to the case
and Naples prosecutors have requested he be indicted.      Lavitola was sent to prison in Naples in April after
spending over six months in South America as a fugitive of
Italian justice, and on March 4 he received a two-year,
eight-month sentence for blackmailing Berlusconi to keep mum
about payments to escorts.
