#titolo Soccer: Juventus to face Bayern in Champions League quarters - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Rome, March 15 - Juventus face a tough challenge in
the Champions League quarter-finals after being pitched against
Bayern Munich in the quarter-finals in Friday's draw in Nyon,
Switzerland.      The German giants, who lost to Chelsea in last season's
final and knocked out Arsenal in the last 16, look sure to cause
more problems than Glasgow side Celtic, who Juve turfed out 5-0
on aggregate in the previous round.      "The Germans are difficult to play against and difficult to
beat because they never give up," Juventus director and former
player Pavel Nedved told Sky television.      "Bayern are one of the scariest teams that we could have
got. They are experienced and very good".      Bayern have been crowned European Champions four times,
most recently in 2001.      Juve, European champions in 1985 and 1996, will consider
themselves unlucky as several of the teams in the draw, such as
Turkey's Galatasaray, Spain's Malaga and Germany's Borussia
Dortmund, looked far tougher prospects. 
     But the Italian champions have at least avoided tournament
favourites Barcelona, who thumped AC Milan 4-0 in the last-16
return for a stunning comeback after losing the first leg 2-0,
and Real Madrid.  
     Juve will travel to Bavaria for the first leg on Tuesday
April 2 and the return in Turin will be on Wednesday April 10.      Barcelona will take on Paris Saint-Germain, Real Madrid
face Galatasaray and Malaga meet Borussia Dortmund in the other
quarter-finals.  
     Nedved played down talk of Juve winning the Champion
League.      "We must not walk before we can run," said the Czech. "I'm
happy that we are here".
