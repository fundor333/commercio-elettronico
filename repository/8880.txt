#titolo EU porn-ban resolution rejected - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Brussels, March 12 - The European Parliament
cancelled a resolution on Tuesday that would have banned all
forms of pornography in media and advertising, including the
Internet, as part of a resolution for "the elimination of gender
stereotypes in Europe".  
     Some 625 members of the EU Parliament voted 368-159 in
favor of passing a resolution aimed at stamping out gender
stereotypes throughout the 27-member union. 
     However a controversial "porn ban" section of the proposal
was rejected.      The so-called porn ban, first submitted to the Parliament
in December, stirred controversy after MPs found wide-ranging
and ill-defined measures buried in the text calling for a "ban
on all forms of pornography in the media," as well as giving
Internet service providers "policing rights" over their
subscribers.
