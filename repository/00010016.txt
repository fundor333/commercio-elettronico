#titolo Imam of Al-Azhar hopes papal relations can 'normalise' - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Cairo, March 13 - Ahmed el-Tayeb, the Grand Imam
of Al-Azhar, hopes the election of Francis I as pope can
normalise relations with the Islamic world, the diplomatic
advisor to one of the most influential figures for Sunni Muslims
said Wednesday.      Francis's predecessor Benedict XVI angered the Islamic
world when in 2006 he quoted a past emperor who called Islam
'evil and inhuman'.       Benedict's appeals on the behalf of Christian minorities
suffering attacks in the Muslim world were also seem by some as
interference.      "Let's hope now that relations return to normal," the
advisor, Mahmud Abdel Gawad, told ANSA adding that el-Tayeb will
send Francis a telegram on Thursday.
