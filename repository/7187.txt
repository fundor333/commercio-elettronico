#titolo Sodano calls for Church 'unity' in pre-conclave homily - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Vatican City, March 12 - Cardinal Angelo Sodano,
dean of the College of Cardinals, called for Church unity in his
homily during the pre-conclave 'pro eligendo Romano Pontifice'
mass in St Peter's Nasilica on Tuesday. 
     ''St. Paul teaches that each of us must work to build up
the unity of the Church so that 'From him the whole body, joined
and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds
itself up in love, as each part does its work','' said the
former Vatican secretary of state commenting on Paul's letter to
the Ephesians.      ''Each of us is therefore called to cooperate with the
successor of Peter, the visible foundation of such an ecclesial
unity,'' he concluded.      The mass was the final liturgical act of the college of
cardinals before they enter into conclave later on Tuesday to
elect a new pope to succeed Benedict XVI, who abdicated due to
diminishing physical and mental strength last month.
