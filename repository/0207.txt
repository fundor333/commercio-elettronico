#titolo Recovery of stolen masterpiece a big win for authorities - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Venice, March 12 - The recovery of a stolen
14th-century masterpiece by Venetian painter Paolo Veneziano
demonstrates the validity of tools currently available to law
enforcement agencies, a state prosecutor said Tuesday.      Commenting the recovery from Germany on Monday of a stolen
panel painted by Veneziano between 1335-1345, state prosecutor
Giampiero Schiesaro said: "The defense of the common good
becomes a priority for (Italy), because through this matter we
demonstrated the possibility, through currently available
instruments, to sequester artwork stolen from Italy since 1909".      The crucifix-shaped panel, measuring 280 by 250 centimeters
and depicting Christ with the Virgin and Saint John on the arms
with an angel up above, was uncovered last year in an
ex-soldier's private residence in Germany by local authorities.      It was smuggled abroad by Germans from the Church of San
Pantaleone in Venice, to where it was returned Monday.
