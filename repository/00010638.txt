#titolo Gunman in Camorra murder of innocent man arrested - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Naples, March 13 - Italian police on Wednesday
arrested a suspected member of the Neapolitan Camorra mafia who
killed an innocent man in a mistaken hit as part of a drugs turf
war in Naples in October.     Salvatore Baldassarre, 30, was caught holed up in a flat.     On the night of October 15 Baldassare put 14 bullets into
Pasquale 'Lino' Romano, 30, believing him to be a member of a
rival clan.     Police said Baldassare was caught on a wiretap telling a
fellow member of his clan: "When I start shooting, I never
stop".     The murder of Romano, a worker in a cable-making firm who
was visiting his girlfriend that night, spurred street protests
calling for more action against the Naples Mob.     Officials vowed to do more to combat turf wars that have
reaped dozens of victims in the southern Italian city in the
last five years.
