#titolo India's diplomatic mission in Italy reduced - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - New Delhi, March 15 - The Indian foreign ministry
has reduced its diplomatic mission in Italy, sources said on
Friday.       Newly appointed Indian Ambassador Basant Kumar Gupta was
scheduled to leave for Rome on Friday.     
      A diplomatic row over Italian marines accused of killing
two Indian fishermen last year intensified Thursday after
Italy's decision not to send them back after a trip home to vote
in February's general election.       On Thursday, India's Supreme Court told the Italian
ambassador to New Delhi, Daniele Mancini, he was not to leave
the country.
