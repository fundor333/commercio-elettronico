    (ANSA) - Vatican City, March 12 - Cardinal Angelo Sodano
invited the faithful to pray for the next pope to be generous
hearted and thanked former pontiff Benedict XVI as he presided
over Tuesday's pre-conclave "pro eligendo Romano Pontifice" mass
at St. Peter's.      "Let's pray so that the Lord grants us a pontiff who
carries out his luminous mission with a generous heart," Sodano,
the dead of the College of Cardinals, said at the end of his
homily.      Earlier in the service, Italian Sodano expressed the
Church's thanks to Benedict, who stepped down as pontiff last
month saying he no longer had the mental and physical strength
to continue in a post that is usually for life.      "We renew all our of profound gratitude to Benedict XVI,"
said Sodano, sparking warn applause from the other cardinals and
faithful gathered.
