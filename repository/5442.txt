#titolo Austrian cardinal hopes pope will restore Church's name - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Berlin, March 14 - The election of Pope Francis
was a "positive surprise" that will hopefully help the Church
regain some face, Austrian Cardinal Christoph Schoenborn told
Austrian Press Agency (APA) Thursday.       "We all hope that the Pope restores the good name of the
Vatican," Schoenborn said.       "The good name of the Church has been damaged by the
mistakes of a few black sheep," he told APA.
