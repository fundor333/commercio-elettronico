#titolo Cardinals 'in good mood' - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Vatican City, March 13 - Cardinals went into their
second day of voting for Benedict XVI's successor in "a good
mood", Vatican Spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said
Wednesday.     He said some of the cardinals had refused transport from
their nearby accommodation and had reached the Sistine Chapel on
foot.     Three votes so far have produced no agreement on the
Catholic Church's 266th pope.
