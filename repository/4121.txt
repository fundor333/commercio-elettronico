#titolo Soccer:Italy may be 'forced' to consider Totti for World Cup - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Florence, March 18 - Italy will be obliged to call
up Francesco Totti for next year's World Cup in Brazil if the
36-year-old continues to play so well for his club AS Roma,
Italy coach Cesare Prandelli said Monday.      Totti, who was part of Italy's 2006 World Cup-winning team,
become Serie A's second-highest scorer when he notched his 226th
league goal in Roma's 2-0 win over Parma on Sunday, one goal
more than Sweden's Gunnar Nordahl who played for AC Milan and
Roma in the 1950s.      "If Francesco Totti is still in this form next year and he
has the same motivation, we'll be obliged to take him into
consideration a month before the start of the World Cup,"
Prandelli told reporters.      "It's difficult to talk about it now. But he seems like a
boy. He has strong motivation and incredible qualities".      Totti retired from international football after the 2006
World Cup but has occasionally hinted he would be willing to
come out of it for a big tournament.      Prandelli's squad assembled at the Azzurri's training base
near Florence on Monday ahead of Thursday's friendly against
Brazil in Geneva and next week's World Cup qualifier in Malta.  
     Italy lead European World Cup qualifying group B with 10
points from four games, four points more than second-placed
Bulgaria.
