    (ANSA) - Rome, March 15 - The India government is holding
the Italian ambassador to New Delhi hostage after telling him he
cannot leave the country, Italian diplomats union SNDMAE said
Friday.       The Supreme Court in New Delhi slapped the ban on
Ambassador Daniele Mancini after the Italian government's
decision not to return to India two marines accused of killing
two Indian fishermen while on an anti-piracy mission last year. They had been granted a permit to come home to vote in last
month's general election.      The union said New Delhi was violating the Vienna
Convention on diplomatic relations, specifically article 44,
which it said aims to stop diplomats "being taken hostage while
carrying out their duties, as is happening to Ambassador
Mancini".
