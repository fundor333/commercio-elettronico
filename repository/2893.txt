#titolo Five life sentences confirmed for boy's Mafia killers - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Palermo, March 18 - A Palermo appeals court on
Monday upheld five life-sentences meted out in the lower court
for the kidnapping, detainment and murder of the son of a Mafia
criminal turned government witness.      Giuseppe Di Matteo, the 13-year-old son of
mobster-turned-informant Santino Di Matteo, was kept by
abductors for nearly two years before being strangled and
dissolved in acid in January 1996.      Italy's maximum sentence was confirmed for Brancaccio mafia
boss Giuseppe Graviano, fugitive Trapani boss Matteo Messina
Denaro, Francesco Giuliano, Salvatore Benigno and Luigi
Giacolone. 
     A 12-year sentence was confirmed for state witness Gaspare
Spatuzza, for whom special mitigating factors for government
informants were applied. 
     The panel of appeals judges tripled damages to be paid to
the mother and brother of the victim. 
     The mother's compensation was raised from 100,000 to
300,000 euros. 
     The brother's increased from 50,000 to 150,000 euros. 
     Santino Di Matteo took part in the assassination of judge
Giovanni Falcone in 1992, and after his June 1993 arrest became
one of the first of Falcone's killers to become a government
witness.      In retaliation, the Sicilian Mafia abducted Di Matteo's son
Giuseppe, then 11, in November 1993.
