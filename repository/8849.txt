    (ANSA) - Rome, March 18 - Italy's foreign ministry on Monday
said the travel ban imposed on its ambassador to India by that
country's Supreme Court violates international law.      In a statement, the foreign ministry said: "The decision by
the Supreme Court to bar our ambassador from leaving the country
without the court's permission constitutes an evident violation
of the Vienna Conventions on diplomatic relations which codifies
universally accepted principals".

continues to believe that the case of its two marines has to be
resolved according to international law. 
    "In this sense we have proposed to subject to arbitration or
other juridical mechanism the solution of the case".
