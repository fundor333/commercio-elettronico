#titolo Rumours of pope's ties to 'Dirty War' mudslinging, says Pell - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Sydney, March 15 - Australia Cardinal George Pell
said on Friday in an interview with ABC radio that the
controversy over the role of Pope Francis during Argentina's
brutal military dictatorship in the late 1970s was simply "a
smear and lie".      "Stories have been dismissed years and years ago," he said.      "The head of Amnesty International at the time said those
charges were completely false. They were...laid to rest years
ago."
     When asked if the newly-elected pontiff should respond to
questions about his alleged inaction during Argentina dictator
Jorge Rafael Videla's 'Dirty War', Pell said, "No, absolutely
not".      Articles critical of Pope Francis' role while still a
Jesuit priest in his home city of Buenos Aires during the
dictatorship years appeared Thursday in papers ranging from the
New York Times to Spain's El Mundo and even Argentina's Pagina
12.
