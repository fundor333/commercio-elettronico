#titolo EU calls on Italy, India to respect Vienna Convention - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Brussels, March 18 - The European Union on Monday
called on Italy and India to honor the Vienna Convention on
Diplomatic Relations in the two countries' spat over two Italian
marines wanted in India for killing two fishermen. 
     "The Vienna Convention must be respected by both parties,"
said a spokesman for Catherine Ashton, EU foreign affairs
representative.      The international treaty was negotiated in 1961 and says
the rights of diplomats are "inviolable" and they cannot be
detained. 
     On Monday, the Indian Supreme Court said Italian Ambassador
Daniele Mancini had "automatically lost" his diplomatic immunity
when the Italian government refused to return anti-piracy
marines Massimilano Latorre and Salvatore Girone for trial after
the ambassador signed a guarantee. 
     The two men had been allowed to come home last month to
vote in Italy's general election. 
     Last week the Italian government announced that the marines
will not return, sparking a furious reaction from New Delhi.    
     Rome has always denied that India has jurisdiction over the
matter, as the incident took place in international waters.     
     Italian Foreign Minister Giulio Terzi said last week that
the decision to not return the pair was legitimate and Italy had
a strong case which it wanted to put to independent arbitration.      An earlier deal, which allowed the marines to return to
Italy for Christmas, was respected by both governments and was
seen as a positive step - as well as a sign of goodwill -
towards a diplomatic solution. 
     On Monday the India Supreme Court adjourned Mancini's case
until April 2 and said he was not to leave the country before
then.
