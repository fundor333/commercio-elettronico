#titolo Pope Francis to begin second day with cardinal talks - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Vatican City, March 15 - Pope Francis will begin
his second day as the new leader of the world's 1.2 billion
Catholics with an informal meeting with cardinals at the
Vatican's Clementine Hall on Friday.      "No speeches are expected," according to Vatican Spokesman
Father Federico Lombardi. 
     "It's an opportunity to greet one another".      On Thursday, Francis led the cardinals in a mass
celebrating Mary at the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore St Mary
Major), the Roman cathedral dedicated to the mother of Christ.      He said the Church risked becoming "an NGO" if it did not
keep following the message of Christ and told Argentine would-be
pilgrims to stay at home and give the money they would have
spent on a trip to Rome to charity. 
     The next event on Francis's schedule is a meeting with the
media at the Vatican's Paul VI Hall at 11:00 Italian time on
Saturday.      He will give his first Angelus address on Sunday. 
     On Tuesday, the inaugural mass of Francis's papacy will
start at 9:30 local time and it will take place in St Peter's
Square, weather permitting, Lombardi said.      The spokesman added that the general audience of the pope,
which usually takes place Wednesday, will not be held next week
because the faithful will have the opportunity to greet Francis
at the inaugural mass.
