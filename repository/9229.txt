#titolo Two Turin drug rings busted in police operation - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Turin, March 12 - Police on Tuesday arrested 14
people in relation to alleged drug dealing in the province
around the northern Italian city of Turin. 
     The suspects belonged to two separate organisations that
between them had held the monopoly on the cocaine and hashish
trade in the area for a decade.      One of the people arrested was a 52-year-old taxi driver
who used his vehicle to deliver the drugs.      Part of the groups' strategy included offering the first
dose of cocaine for free to beat competition and attract new
customers.
