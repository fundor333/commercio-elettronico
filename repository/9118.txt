#titolo All of Benedict's last day as pope to be recorded - Diario Vaticano
(ANSA) - Vatican City, February 20 - The Vatican Television Centre (CTV) has said virtually every moment of Pope Benedict XVI's last day as pontiff will be recorded for posterity. 
Benedict will become the first pope in over seven centuries to voluntarily step down as the head of the Catholic Church on February 28 and for the first time cameras will be able to capture a moment of such historic importance. 
The highlight will be when the 85-year-old German, who says he no longer has the physical and mental strength to lead the world's 1.2 billion Catholics, leaves the Vatican by helicopter to take up temporary residence at the pontifical summer residence at Castel Gandolfo near Rome. 
"The departure will be a historic event," said Mons. 
Edoardo Maria Vigano', CTV's director. 
Vigano' said the details of precisely how much of the day would be recorded without invading too much Benedict's privacy had not yet been settled. 
Benedict will move back to a monastery inside the Vatican when renovation work is complete in a few months.
