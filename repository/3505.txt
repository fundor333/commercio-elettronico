     (ANSA) - Milan, March 15 - Major European stock exchanges
made a weak showing on Friday, while markets awaited the outcome
of the two-day European Council summit in Brussels.      Milan's FTSE-Mib lost 0.43% to close at 16,061 points,
while Europe's biggest loser was Paris's CAC 40 index, down
0.80%. 
     Madrid's IBEX 35 and London's FTSE-100 slipped 0.61% and
0.65% respectively. 
     Frankfurt's DAX index was nearly flat, losing 0.19%.      Interest rates on Italian bonds closed 314 basis points
higher than the German bund on Friday, while the yield on
Italian 10-year bonds was 4.6%. 
     The spread between Italian bonds and the German benchmark
is a key measure of Italy's borrowing costs and of investor
confidence in the country's ability to weather the eurozone
crisis. 
     The difference between the Italian and Spanish spreads
continued to widen on Friday to 32 basis points, compared to 21
points Thursday, and 10 points on Wednesday.
