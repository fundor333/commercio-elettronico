     (ANSA) - Rome, March 13 - The seagull that rose to global
prominence on Wednesday by perching on the chimney of the
Sistine Chapel as the world watched to see if cardinals at the
conclave had elected a new pope had a Twitter account set up for
him by admirers soon after.      "Hanging out on the Sistine Chapel Chimney, livetweeting,"
was the first tweet posted for him.      "OMG SOMEBODY DROPPED A CHEETO! BRB, SOMEBODY KEEP AN EYE
ON THE SMOKE FOR ME," was the second.
