#titolo Susa Valley show globe in Paris - English News
     (ANSA) - PARIS - A massive snow globe has arrived in Paris in
front of the Louvre following stops in Barcelona and Brussels to
promote the mountains in the north valley of Susa. The event was
attended by Piedmont Tourism councillor Alberto Cirio and the
Mayor of Paris's first Arrondissment Jean Francois Legaret. 
   Speaking at the ceremony, Legaret recalled that the snow
globe, or boule a' neige, which became so popular in the second
half of the 1900s, had originated in France. These first went on
public display in Paris during the first Expo, staged in 1878.    Paris is the third and final stage in an international voyage
that has seen the large-scale crystal ball, almost five metres
in diameter and four metres high, travel first to Barcelona
(December 2-3) and then to Brussels (December 6-7). Its interior
features a plastic reproduction of the mountains of the North
Susa Valley mountains, complete with snowboard, skis, Olympic
torch, an enormous chocolate, a bottle of wine and signposts
marking the locations of the area's various towns. Visitors -
who have so far numbered over 10,000 in Barcelona and Brussels -
can enter the snow globe in person, to experience and 'explore'
the mountains, complete with a gentle snowfall. The aim is to
introduce visitors to the local specialties and deals available
at Bardonecchia Ski and the Via Lattea. There is also a prize
draw for accommodation for the 2011-2012 winter season, while
more details can be found at the website

market for the Susa Alps valley, both because typical Parisian
visitors are likely to be particularly responsive to Italian
attractions and because of the high-speed TGV train connections
operated by SNCF, which provide affordable connections of just a
few hours between the French capital and towns such as Oulx and
Bardonecchia. (ANSA).
