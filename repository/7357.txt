#titolo No 'special' invites for pope's inauguration, says Lombardi - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Vatican City, March 18 - No special invitations
were sent out to foreign delegations for the inauguration of
Pope Francis, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said on
Monday.      "There is an appointment set and those who choose to come
are welcome," he said.      International delegates arriving in Rome for Tuesday's
election of Benedict XVI's successor include the controversial
leader of Zimbabwe, Robert Gabriel Mugabe, defying an EU travel
ban.      "Who is coming wanted to come and no one has said
otherwise. There are no privileged (guests)," Lombardi said.
