#titolo Dalai Lama 'touched' by Pope Francis's choice of name - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Shanghai, March 15 - The Dalai Lama on Friday said he
was "touched" by Pope Francis's decision to pick the name of
humble, Nature-loving monk St Francis of Assisi.     The exiled Tibetan spiritual leader said he was "no expert
on Catholic saints" but had been to Assisi several times for
inter-religious gatherings and was well acquainted with the
story of St Francis.     "His discipline, the simplicity of his life and his love for
all creatures are qualities which I find highly inspiring.     "I am really touched to know that is the name chosen by the
Pope," he said on his website.     "I hope I will soon have the honour to meet Francis as I did
his predecessors Benedict and John Paul II, with whom I had
friendly conversations over the last 40 years or so," added the
Lama, who has been living in exile in India since a failed
Tibetan uprising against Chinese rule in 1959.
