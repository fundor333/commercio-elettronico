#titolo Italian marines decision 'unacceptable', says India - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - New Delhi, March 12 - Indian Premier Manmohan Singh
on Tuesday described as ''absolutely unacceptable'' Italy's
decision not to send back two marines for trial on charges of
homicide relating to the alleged killing of two Indian fishermen
during an anti-piracy mission in February 2012.      He also said he would ask Foreign Minister Salman Khurshid
to take up the matter with Italy. 
     On Monday the Italian government announced that
Massimiliano Latorre and Salvatore Girone would not be returning
to face trial in India after the supreme court in New Delhi
granted them a four-week permit to exercise their right to vote
in last month's general elections. 
     They were also allowed back for the Christmas holidays and
returned to India once their leave expired. 
     They had pledged to do so in this case as well. 
     However in a statement Monday, the foreign ministry said
that ''the conduct of Indian authorities violated international
rights'' by detaining them for over a year.      It also said it was open to allowing an international
arbitrator assess the case. 
     The chief minister of Kerala, the southern state off which
the incident occurred, also described Italy's decision as
''unacceptable''.      Meanwhile on Tuesday local fishermen burned images of the
Indian Premier and one of the marines in protest over the
decision.
