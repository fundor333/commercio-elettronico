#titolo Soccer: Lazio drawn against Fenerbahce in Europa League - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Rome, March 15 - Lazio were drawn against Istanbul
side Fenerbahce in the Europa League quarter-finals on Friday.      The Rome side will have to play the home leg behind closed
doors after being handed a two-match stadium ban from European
soccer's governing body UEFA for racism by some fans.      The ban was imposed along with a 40,000-euro fine following
a February match against Germany's Borussia Moenchengladbach
when a group of Lazio fans gave a Fascist straight-armed salute.      The ban was the latest in a series of sanctions from UEFA
for racist gestures by fans at previous games this season.      These included fans chanting 'Juden Tottenham' during a
group-stage match in November. 
     Fans of London side Tottenham take pride in having a Jewish
identify even though their followers come from a variety of
religious and ethnic backgrounds.      The incident took place a day after a group of Tottenham
fans were brutally set upon by masked thugs in a central Rome
pub, an attack that was linked to anti-Semitism.      Lazio served the first part of the stadium ban on Thursday,
when they beat VfB Stuttgart 3-1 at an empty Stadio Olimpico to
complete a 5-1 aggregate win in the last 16. 
     The Romans are the only Italian side left in the
competition. 
     Inter Milan beat Tottenham 4-1 on Thursday but went out on
away goals after losing the first leg 3-0.
