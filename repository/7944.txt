#titolo Berlusconi sex trial postponed again - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Milan, March 18 - A Milan court on Monday ordered
another delay in the trial into allegations ex-premier Silvio
Berlusconi paid to have sex with an underage prostitute.      The trial had already been adjourned three times after
Berlusconi spent over a week in hospital with a condition
reportedly caused by someone poking him in the eye and the
resultant high blood pressure. 
     The court said the trial would resume on March 25 and
cancelled the hearings scheduled to take place on Wednesday and
Thursday.      Prosecutors, who made the court send medical inspectors to
check on Berlusconi's condition last week, had asked the judges
not to delay the trial again, saying the 76-year-old media
magnate was in "contempt of court" for playing for time.
