#titolo Benedict won't be 'shadow pope', says brother - Diario Vaticano
(ANSA) - Rome, February 21 - Benedict XVI will not be a "shadow pope" after he steps down as pontiff, according to his elder brother Georg Ratzinger. 
Benedict, 85, shocked the world on February 11 when he announced he would step down from a position that is usually for life at the end of the month. 
He said his age meant he no longer had the physical and mental strength to lead the Catholic Church. 
The move sparked speculation that Benedict's presence could overshadow the work of his successor. 
But the German pontiff has said he will remain "hidden to the world" after he steps down and his brother says there is no chance of him causing problems for the next pope. 
"The head of the Church needs to be a person in possession of all their energies," Ratzinger, a priest in Regensburg, told Corriere della Sera.       "It was a human choice inspired by God, an act of responsibility... He will not be a shadow pope. 
"He doesn't want to put his successor in difficulty". 
 Ratzinger, who previously said he knew of his brother's decision months before it was announced, added that "I think he will continue to call himself Benedict XVI".
