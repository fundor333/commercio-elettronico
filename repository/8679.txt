#titolo Francis in Naples crib - ANSA English
(ANSA) - Naples, March 14 - A statuette of new Pope Francis has already been placed in one of the Christmas crib shops Naples is famous for. 
The statuette crib-maker Gennaro Di Virgilio made after Francis's election Wednesday night spurred demands for replicas from Neapolitans and tourists Thursday.       It depicts the smiling Argentinian pontiff with his arms wide open, welcoming people.      "I made it overnight, he's wearing the same clothes as last night, it's a single piece painted in oils," Di Virgilio told journalists. 
He said he hoped to be able to give a copy to Francis as she did with his predecessor Benedict XVI, who abdicated last month to usher in the election of the first non-European pope in 1,300 years.
