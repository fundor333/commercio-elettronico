#titolo ANSA photo symbolises Pope's shock resignation - Speciali
(ANSA) - Rome, February 11 - A stunning image of a lightning bolt hitting the dome of St. Peter's, taken by an ANSA photographer on Monday, has come to symbolise Pope Benedict XVI's shock announcement that he will step down at the end of this month. 
 ANSA photographer Alessandro Di Meo ( www.alessandrodimeo.com ) said it was not just luck that he managed to take the shot. He took a long series of photos before getting it and he had to combat difficult conditions after he saw that a thunder storm was heading towards the Vatican following the historic announcement. 
 "I realise that the photo might seem incredible, but I've always taken lightning shots," Di Meo said. "The only difference in this case is that it was the right lightning bolt, in the right place, at the right time".Â
