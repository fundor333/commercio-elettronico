#titolo Speakerships votes flop as Italian deadlock continues - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Rome, March 15 - Votes for speakers in both the
Senate and House in Italy were inconclusive Friday as the
center-left Democratic Party (PD) led a drive to submit blank
ballots in the hope of buying more time for negotiations. 
     In the Senate, 246 senators out of 315 did not support
candidates, while 459 out of 630 in the House did the same,
forcing new rounds of voting. 
     Pier Luigi Bersani, the head of the PD, said his party
would submit blank votes in order to have more time to reach
common ground with the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement (M5S)
of comedian Beppe Grillo, whose stunning performance in February
elections wrested enough support from the center left in the
Senate to create gridlock in the first session of parliament
Friday. 
     The center-right People of Freedom (PdL) party of
ex-premier Silvio Berlusconi also performed surprisingly well in
elections, and has said it too would submit blank ballots for
speakers. 
     Grillo, whose euro-skeptic, anti-tax and largely populist
platform has vaulted his party to the top of current opinion
polls, has said he wants to "open the parliament like a can of
tuna".
