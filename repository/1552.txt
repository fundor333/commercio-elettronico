#titolo Over one third Italians say Bersani should take a step back - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Rome, March 15 - Just over one third of Italians
believe centre-left leader Pier Luigi Bersani should take a step
back to allow the formation of a new government after February
general elections left no party or coalition with a clear
majority, an opinion poll said Friday. 
     Instead 28% of Italians think the Democratic Party (PD)
secretary should pursue an alliance with the anti-establishment
5-Star Movement (M5S) of comedian Beppe Grillo, according to the
Trieste-based pollster SWG.      This figure rises to 66% among centre-left voters. 
     So far attempts by the PD to reach a government agreement
with M5S have proved elusive. 
     Some 13% of Italians support an alliance between PD and the
centre-right People of Freedom (PdL) of ex-premier Silvio
Berlusconi. 
     The same percentage instead sees new elections as the only
answer to the present deadlock.
