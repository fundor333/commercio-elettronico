#titolo Snow caps Vesuvius - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Naples, March 15 - Naples residents woke up Friday
to the unseasonal sight of snow on Vesuvius.      The mist and rainclouds that had ringed the volcano for
days rolled away to reveal a heavy white topping.      Snow is unusual on Vesuvius at this time of the year but,
like the rest of Italy, Naples has been hit by a late cold snap
over the past week.
