#titolo Sculpture route devoted to Gio Pomodoro - English News
     (ANSA) - ALESSANDRIA - A new, multi-part exhibition devoted
to the works of the Le Marche sculptor Gio' Pomodoro has opened
in Monferrato, spread among the province's six municipalities.    Entitled Gio' Pomodoro 1954-2011: The Path of a Sculptor, the
initiative is split between villas, historic palaces and
museums, who have teamed up to create a circuit designed to
carry visitors on a literal voyage around the works of the
internationally renowned sculptor. 
   The project aims to explore the humanist and philosophical
side of Pomodoro, who has always sought to give shape to space
and stories as places that form the backdrop to human existence. The artist has used a multitude of materials and experimented
with a multiplicity of forms, starting with his earliest
bas-reliefs and 'panel' sculptures. 
   The initiative carries visitors around the province's most
charming and interesting towns, including Alessandria. Acqui
Terme, Novi Ligure, Valenza, Tortona and Casale Monferrato. 
   There are nine exhibition seats in total showcasing 173 works
that explore the poetic and aesthetic characteristics of Gio
Pomodoro's extraordinary and monumental works. Casale Monferrato
Mayor Giorgio Demezzi recently unveiled a large-scale bronze
piece by Pomodoro created in 1961 and entitled Follia Grande
(Great Madness), which will be exhibited in the courtyard of
Palazzo Magnocavalli until April 29. (ANSA).
