#titolo Sicilian priest disavows regional governor over pope - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Gela (Caltanissetta), March 15 - A Sicilian priest,
the personal confessor of centre-left regional Governor Rosario
Crocetta, disavowed the politician on Friday for what he
considered to be ''inappropriate'' ethical and religious
statements.      The recently elected governor, who is openly gay, told
private national TV channel L7 on Wednesday that in order to
draw close to the public the Church needed ''a woman pope,
married priests and even to celebrate gay marriage''.      Luigi Petralia, a parish priest in Crocetta's native Gela,
in an open letter described the comments as being those ''of a
showman rather than of a politician or a Christian politician''
and said that they effectively placed Crocetta ''outside the
Catholic Church''.      ''They are very serious issues that have already been
resolved within the Catholic Church, which does not expect
answers from Crocetta, seeing as he is neither a biblical
scholar nor a theologian, and that he does not hold any other
title indicating competence in these matters,'' he wrote.       
     Petralia added that the governor could be forgiven in
confession and return to the Church only if he showed sincere
repentance for the comments.
