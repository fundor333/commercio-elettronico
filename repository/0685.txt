#titolo Rugby: Ireland match will be Lo Cicero's last for Italy - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Rome, March 15 - Italy prop Andrea Lo Cicero said
Friday that he will retire from international rugby after
Saturday's Six Nations match against Ireland in Rome.      The popular 36-year-old became the Azzurri's all-time most
capped player when he came on as a replacement in last week's
18-11 defeat in England to make his 102nd international
appearance.      "I've made a very tough decision. I want to take part in
the 2015 World Cup," he joked before making the announcement
that "tomorrow's match will be my last (with Italy)".      He explained that "I think it's time to make room for the
lads who will go to the World Cup".      Lo Cicero, who plays club rugby in France for Paris side
Racing Metro 92, is nicknamed 'Il Barone' (the baron) because
his family has noble roots.      He made his first appearance for the national team against
England in Italy's debut Six Nations campaign in 2000.      "It's my duty to stand aside, even though I'm physically in
good shape and I think I could still play at a high level,"
added the forward, who hinted he would quit rugby altogether at
the end of the season.
