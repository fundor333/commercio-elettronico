#titolo EU wants 'solution respectful of laws' for Italian marines - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Brussels, March 12 - The EU hopes that "a solution
which fully respects UN conventions, along with international
maritime laws" will be found for the two Italian marines charged
in India with killing two local fishermen.      The Italian government announced Monday that marines
Salvatore Latorre and Massimiliano Girone would remain in Italy
and not return to India after being allowed to come home to vote
in February's general election.      The marines have been at the centre of a diplomatic row
between Italy and India for shooting Jelestine Valentine and
Ajesh Binki during an international anti-piracy mission off the
southern Kerala coast in February 2012.       A statement by the High Representative of the Union for
Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Catherine Ashton, said on
Tuesday that the EU "is strongly committed to the fight against
piracy at the global level.      Last month, India's Supreme Court granted a request from
the two marines to return to Italy for four weeks so they could
vote in general elections.      Latorre and Girone were also allowed to return home for the
Christmas holidays and went back to India after their leave
ended.      Italy had pledged to do so in this case as well but the
foreign ministry announced that the two would not be returning
to India on March 23 as scheduled.      The government said in a statement Monday that "the conduct
of Indian authorities violated international rights" by
detaining them since last February.      For one year the Italian government has been working to get
the trial moved to Italian courts since the events took place
aboard an Italian ship in international waters.      The EU Commission "takes note of the statement by the
Italian Foreign Minister Terzi", said the Commission.
