#titolo Beppe Grillo calls M5S 'French revolution' w/out guillotine - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Rome, March 13 - Beppe Grillo, leader of the
Italian 5-Star Movement (M5S), called his populist and
anti-establishment group's hand in Italy's current political
uncertainty a "French revolution" but that Europe "should not be
afraid", in an interview with the German newspaper Handelsblatt
published Wednesday.      Grillo also challenged Germans to explain why its country's
economy is uniquely thriving in the eurozone. 
     M5S's strong 25% voter-support at Italy's parliament
election in late February has thrown Italian government
transition into gridlock.      "Europe shouldn't be afraid," said the movement leader, who
explained that what is needed is a "strong inversion and more
democracy".      Grillo, whose political rallying tactics are based on
Internet forums and street gatherings, proposed holding an
"online referendum" on whether Italy should remain in the single
currency, "just as there should have been a vote on the Lisbon
treaty" - themes on which, he claims "our (Italian) constitution
was ignored". 
     "We are the French revolution, without the guillotine,"
Grillo declared, but then clarified that he is not anti-Europe. 
     "I only said that I wanted a plan B for Europe. We must ask
ourselves what has happened to Europe, why is there no common
information policy, no common tax policy, no common immigration
policy, and why only Germany has enriched itself," Grillo
explained.     "Italy is de facto already out of the euro," Grillo
continued, saying northern European countries will keep Italy in
the eurozone only "until their banks get their investments back
on Italian treasury bonds; then they'll let us fall like a hot
potato".
