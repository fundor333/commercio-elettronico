     (ANSA) - Vatican City, March 13 - Francis I said he wanted
to lead the Catholic Church on a path of love and fraternity
after being elected pope on Wednesday.      "Let's start this path of the Church of Rome together,
bishop and people together, (a path) of fraternity, love and
trust among us," said Francis, whose great-grandfather was from
the northern Italian region of Piedmont.      "Let's pray for one another, for the whole world, so that
there is great fraternity.      "I hope that this path that we start today is fruitful for
evangelization".   
     Francis led the faithful in reciting the Lord's Prayer and
asked the crowd to pray for him before blessing the people
gathered in St. Peter's Square. He then bid the faithful
goodnight and wished them "good rest".
