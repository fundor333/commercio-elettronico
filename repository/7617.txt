#titolo One third of Italians think Berlusconi is persecuted - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Rome, March 15 - Some 37% of Italians believe the
legal problems of ex-premier Silvio Berlusconi are the result of
judicial persecution according to the results of an SWG poll
released Friday. 
     This figure rises to 92% among centre-right supporters, the
same source said. 
     The survey comes just five days after a demonstration by
members of Berlusconi's People of Freedom (PdL) party
demonstrated outside a Milan courthouse, sending shockwaves
across Italy's political scene. 
     The media magnate is implicated in various cases including
an appeal against a four-year conviction for tax fraud in the
purchase of broadcasting rights by his Mediaset group and a
first-instance trial on charges of paying for sex with an
underage prostitute. 
     Earlier this week he also received an order for immediate
judgment in Naples due to allegations related to graft.
