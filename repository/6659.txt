#titolo Black smoke on second morning of conclave - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Vatican City, March 13 - Black smoke appeared over
the Vatican following the second morning of the cardinals'
conclave on Wednesday, signalling that so far the second day of
voting has failed to produce a new pope.       The voting cardinals will return to their residence of
Santa Marta for lunch, then transfer back to the Sistine Chapel
for afternoon voting that will begin at 16:30 local time.       Two more votes are slated to take place during Wednesday's
afternoon session to elect Benedict XVI's successor.
