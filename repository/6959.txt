     (ANSA) - Milan, March 13 - Milan judges on Wednesday
requested Silvio Berlusconi's doctor send a new medical
certificate so they can assess whether the trial into
allegations the ex-premier had sex with an underage prostitute
should go ahead or be adjourned. 
     Berlusconi has been in Milan's San Raffaele hospital since
Friday with an eye problem.      Hospital sources told ANSA that the 76-year-old media
magnate would stay in hospital again on Wednesday night.
