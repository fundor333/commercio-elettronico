#titolo Black smoke, no new pope yet - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Vatican City, March 12 - Black smoke appeared over
the Vatican following the first day of the cardinals' conclave
to elect Benedict XVI's successor on Tuesday signalling that a
new pope had not been chosen.      Thousands of onlookers expressed disappointment after hours
of waiting in stormy Roman weather to see if white smoke would
indicate that a new pope had been elected.      Cardinals will gather on Wednesday morning in the Sistine
Chapel, when the second day of the conclave to elect the new
pope begins.
