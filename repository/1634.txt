#titolo Clini seeks to dispel 'disinformation' on Concordia cleanup - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Rome, March 18 - Italian Environment Minister
Corrado Clini on Monday said reports that cleaning up the
environmental damage caused by the Costa Concordia shipwreck
would cost the public purse 150 million euros were false.      "A smoky curtain of disinformation is being raised about
the Concordia, (something) which is at the same time
irresponsible and pathetic," Clini said in an open letter to
Italian daily L'Unita' and posted on the ministry's website.      In his letter Clini wrote that there were "facts and
actions" which proved how "the smoke dissolves".      The Concordia ran aground on reefs just off Giglio Island,
off the coast of Tuscany, in January 2012. 
     More than 30 passengers on the cruise liner were killed.
