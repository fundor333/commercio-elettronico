#titolo With Francis, 'we will see change in Church' says cardinal - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Vatican City, March 14 - Canadian Cardinal
Jean-Claude Turcotte said Thursday he expected to see "change"
in the Catholic Church now that Francis is pope. 
     "I'm sure that in a few years you will see change in the
Church," said the archbishop emeritus of Montreal the day after
Jorge Mario Bergoglio, the archbishop of Buenos Aires, was
elevated to the throne of St Peter. 
     "I have known him for many years. I was always struck by
the man, who is a holy, holy man, a man of prayer. 
     "I'm sure that as pope he would like to correct things. The
Church has flaws. We cannot accept that," he said in a press
conference joined by fellow Canadian cardinal Thomas Christopher
Collins, the archbishop of Toronto.  
     "He's not going to change the Gospel, don't worry about
that," said Turcotte.
