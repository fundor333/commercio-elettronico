#titolo Fitch downgrades Italian regions - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Rome, March 13 - Fitch on Tuesday downgraded its
credit rating for most of Italy's regional and provincial
governments and city councils.      The move comes after Fitch cut the Italian State's credit
rating from A- to BBB+, with a negative outlook, last week due
to the "inconclusive result" of Italy's general election last
month.      In most cases, including the cities of Rome and Milan, the
downgrade was the same as Italy's demotion of one notch, from A-
to BBB+.      The exceptions are the regions of Valle D'Aosta, Friuli
Venezia Giulia and Lazio and the province of Bolzano and Trento,
which were downgraded two notches.
