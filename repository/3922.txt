     (ANSA) - Rome, March 14 - Tyre-maker Bridgestone is ready to
negotiate on the planed closure of its plant in Bari, the
governor of the southeastern Puglia region, Nichi Vendola, said
Thursday.     Vendola and Industry Minister Corrado Passera said the
closure was no longer "irrevocable" for the firm.     Local officials and unions hailed the news. 
    On March 4 Bridgestone Europe announced plans Monday to
close the Bari factory next year, throwing 950 people out of
work.      The plant, making car tyres in the Modugno suburb of Bari,
would be shut down no later than the first half of next year,
the company said.      The Bari plant is one of eight in Europe owned by
Bridgestone.
