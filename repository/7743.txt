#titolo EU takes distance from Italian-Indian diplomatic row - ANSA English
     (see related) (ANSA) - Brussels, March 18 - The European Union
distanced itself on Monday from the festering diplomatic row
between Italy and India, which worsened last week when Italy
announced two Italian marines visiting home would not be
returned to India to face trial when their leave expired in late
March.      The EU's high representative for foreign affairs Catherine
Ashton told ANSA in a note that European Union is not part of
the legal dispute between Italy and India and thus can not take
a position with respect to the legal arguments on the substance
of the case.      Ashton encouraged Italy and India to find a "mutually
satisfactory" and "friendly solution" based on the United
Nations Convention on the Law of the Seas and international law.      The Supreme Court in New Delhi on Monday extended its order
for Italian Ambassador Daniele Mancini to stay in Indian
territory, and said Mancini had "automatically lost" his
diplomatic immunity by signing a guarantee that the marines,
Massimiliano Latorre and Salvatore Girone, would return to India
to face charges including killing two Indian fishermen off the
coast of Kerala during an anti-priacy mission last year. Photo: EU's high representative for foreign affairs Catherine
