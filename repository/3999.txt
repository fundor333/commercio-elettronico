#titolo Rugby: Italy make three changes for Ireland clash - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Rome, March 14 - Coach Jacques Brunel has made
three changes to his starting line-up for Italy's final Six
Nations match against Ireland in Rome on Saturday.      Prop Andrea Lo Cicero, 36, returns to the starting XVI
after coming on as a replacement in last week's 18-11 defeat in
England to make his 102nd appearance and become the Azzurri's
all-time most capped player.      Lo Cicero, who replaces Alberto De Marchi, is expected to
announce his retirement from international rugby after
Saturday's match.      The other two changes were enforced by injury.      Lorenzo Cittadini comes in for prop Martin Castrogiovanni,
who came off against England with a muscle strain, and openside
flanker Simone Favaro takes over from Robert Barbieri, who also
suffered a knock at Twickenham.      Italy need to beat Ireland to be sure to avoid finishing
last.      They will be buoyed by their strong performance in London,
where they gave Grand Slam-chasing England a nasty scare, after
disappointing defeats to Wales and Scotland.      Italy are fifth in the table with the two points they
earned by stunning France 23-18 on the opening day. 
     Italy: Andrea Masi, Giovanbattista Venditti, Gonzalo
Canale, Gonzalo Garcia, Luke McLean, Luciano Orquera, Edoardo
Gori; Sergio Parisse (capt), Simone Favaro, Alessandro Zanni,
Joshua Furno, Quintin Geldenhuys, Leonardo Cittadini, Leonardo
Ghiraldini, Andrea Lo Cicero.      Replacements: Davide Giazzon, Michele Rizzo, Alberto De
Marchi, Antonio Pavanello, Francesco Minto, Paul Derbyshire,
Tobias Botes, Tommaso Benvenuti.
