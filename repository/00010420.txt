#titolo Italy's actions could bring 'consequences', says Indian PM - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Rome, March 13 - If the Italian authorities "do not
keep their word" and refuse to send back the two Italian marines
charged with killing two Indian fishermen, "there will be
consequences," Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said on
Wednesday.      Already strained relations between Rome and New Delhi
notched up on Monday when the Italian government announced that
marines Salvatore Latorre and Massimiliano Girone would remain
in Italy and not return to India after being allowed to come
home to vote in February's general election.      The marines have been at the centre of a diplomatic row
between Italy and India for shooting Jelestine Valentine and
Ajesh Binki during an international anti-piracy mission off the
southern Kerala coast in February 2012.      Kerala Chief Minister Oommen Chandy, the southern Indian
state where the incident took place in February 2012, travelled
to New Delhi on Wednesday to ask the prime minister for "strong
action" and said that there could be "no compromise" on the
marines return to India.      Latorre and Girone were also allowed to return home for the
Christmas holidays and went back to India after their leave
ended.      Italy had pledged to do so in this case as well but the
foreign ministry announced that the two would not be returning
to India on March 23 as scheduled.
