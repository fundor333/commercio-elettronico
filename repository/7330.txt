#titolo New pope calls on clergy to 'reach out to those in need' - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Vatican City, March 14 - Newly elected Pope
Francis has asked clergy members to "reach out to those in need
and take the Gospel to the outskirts," Cardinal Fernando Filoni
said on Thursday.       "Even though we may be tired at times, we are called to
evangelize, especially with zeal, which means with love," Filoni
said.       The Argentine pontiff, who was elected the first South
American pope on Wednesday, chose the name Francis in honour of
Francis of Assisi, caretaker of the poor and humble.
