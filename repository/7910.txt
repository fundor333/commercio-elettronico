#titolo Probe launched over fetus found in Milan university fridge - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Milan, March 18 - Milan's Bicocca University will
set up a commission of inquiry to investigate how a human fetus
ended up in a refrigerator in the university's biotechnology
lab.      "We will institute a commission of inquiry inside the
university in collaboration with the Ethics Committee," Marcello
Fontanesi, the university's rector, said during a press
conference Monday.      "If someone inside the university is responsible (for this)
he or she will no longer place foot in this university,"
Fontanesi said.      Meanwhile one of the university's researchers said the case
could be an attempt to "sabotage" the institute's research into
Lou Gehrig's disease.
