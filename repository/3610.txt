#titolo India summons Italian ambassador over marines - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - New Delhi, March 12 - Italian ambassador to New
Delhi, Daniele Mancini, was summoned by the Indian foreign
ministry Tuesday to explain Italy's decision not to send back
two marines accused of killing two Indian fishermen during an
anti-piracy mission in February 2012.      The summons came after Indian Premier Manmohan Singh
described as "absolutely unacceptable" Monday's announcement
that Massimiliano Latorre and Salvatore Girone would not be
returning to face trial in India when a four-week permit to
exercise their right to vote in last month's general elections
expired. 
     The centre-right opposition Bharatya Janata Party (BJP)
said the decision was "a betrayal" and "a deceit against the
Supreme Court of India", which has twice granted the marines a
permit to return home - the first time for Christmas - following
guarantees from the Italian government that they would
subsequently be returned. 
     "Italians think India is a banana republic," the BJP
spokesman said. 
     In a statement Monday, the foreign ministry said that "the
conduct of Indian authorities violated international
rights" by detaining them for over a year, opening to the
possible intervention of an international arbitrator in the
case.      On Tuesday the wife of Gelastine Valentine, one of the two
Kerala fishermen allegedly shot dead by the marines from aboard
the oil tanker Enrica Lexie after mistaking them for pirates,
called for the servicemen to be returned to India because "I
have not yet seen justice done".      Meanwhile the Indian news channel CNN-IBN has been playing
up the fact that just Monday the Italian government bowed to
requests from New Delhi and handed over documents pertaining to
alleged kickbacks paid by defence and aerospace giant
Finmeccanica for the sale of 12 helicopters to India.
