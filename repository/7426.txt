#titolo New pope told cardinals 'may God forgive you' - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Rome, March 14 - Pope Francis showed he still had a
good sense of humour after being elected pontiff, telling the
cardinals who elected him "May God forgive you".      The new head of the Catholic Church "brought the house
down" with the comment when dining with cardinals after the
conclave on Wednesday, according to one of them, Archbishop of
New York Timothy Dolan.      He also told the cardinals, "I hope you don't regret this
later," Dolan told reporters at the North American College in
Rome. 
     Dolan, who was considered one of the favourites to become
pope before the conclave, said Francis had "won our hearts" with
his "beautiful sincerity, simplicity and humility".      He added: "He kind of comes across as shy and reserved,
doesn't he? 
     "His voice is kind of conversational. He doesn't have a
real booming voice, but he's a man of confidence and poise".
