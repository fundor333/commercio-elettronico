#titolo Inflexible rules foster unemployment, says Hollande - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Brussels, March 14 - Arriving at the EU summit,
French President Francois Hollande said that a lack of
flexibility in budget rules led to unemployment and that the
priority now was growth. 
     At the end of the European Socialist Party meeting, before
arriving at the European Council, Hollande noted that a growth
pact had been signed in June 2012 and that it should now be
implemented to affect 2013 as much as possible.
