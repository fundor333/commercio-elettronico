#titolo Let's get to work right now, says M5s's Crimi - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Rome, March 13 - Anti-establishment comic Beppe
Grillo's 5-Star Movement (M5S) prospective Senate caucus leader
Vito Crimi on Wednesday called on all parties to stop wasting
time and get to work cutting government costs, even though
political consultations on what Italy's next government will
look like are still ongoing.      ''This is my challenge. Since you all say you want only to
act in the interests of the people let's not waste a month,
which would also be a waste of a month's salary for 1,000 MPs'',
Crimi wrote on his Facebook page. ''Let's get to work right away
to cut the costs of politics and start helping the neediest. This would be the best, if not the only, sign that you have
actually heard what the Italian people shouted at you from the
voting booths''.      Although a coalition led by the centre-left Democratic
Party (PD) achieved a majority in the House after narrowly
beating a centre-right alliance led by ex-premier Silvio
Berlusconi's People of Freedom (PdL) party, no party or
coalition got a majority in the Senate, producing a hung
parliament.      The anti-establishment, anti-euro and anti-austerity M5S
was the single most-voted party in the House and holds the
balance of power in the Senate.
