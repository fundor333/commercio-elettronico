#titolo Italy on solid legal ground in marines case, FM Terzi says - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Herzliya, March 13 - Italy is on solid legal ground
in seeking international arbitration in the case of two Italian
marines charged with killing two Indian fishermen, Foreign
Minister Giulio Terzi told reporters in Israel on Wednesday.      The marines have been at the centre of a diplomatic row
between Italy and India for shooting Jelestine Valentine and
Ajesh Binki during an international anti-piracy mission off the
southern Kerala coast in February 2012.      Already-strained relations between Rome and New Delhi
notched up on Monday when the Italian government announced that
marines Salvatore Latorre and Massimiliano Girone would remain
in Italy and not return to India to face murder charges after
being allowed to come home to vote in February's general
election.      "We have juridically solid reasons to proceed in the
direction of international arbitration," Terzi told reporters as
he arrived at an international conference organized by the
Institute for Policy and Strategy (IPS), an Israeli think tank. 
     "The Indian government is amply apprised of all it needs to
know about our reasons, as do many of our partners".
