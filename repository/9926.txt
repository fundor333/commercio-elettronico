#titolo Soccer: Milan fear repercussions after Barca drubbing - ANSA English
(ANSA) - Milan, March 13 - AC Milan are focusing on trying to stop Tuesday's 4-0 defeat at Barcelona having repercussions for the domestic campaign after it ended their drive for glory in the Champions League. 
Milan travelled to Barcelona with high hopes of reaching the quarter-finals after winning the first leg 2-0, but they were smashed by a superlative display by the Catalan side and their Argentine forward Leo Messi, who scored two fine goals. 
They are particularly wary as, after being dumped out of the Champions League by Barca in the last eight last season,    Massimiliano Allegri's side lost 2-1 at home to Fiorentina. 
The defeat basically cost Milan the title as it enabled Juventus to overtake them at the top of the table and the Turin side never surrendered the lead. 
Milan have little hope of winning this season's Serie A crown, as they trail leaders Juve by 11 points, but they need to keep hold of third place in the standings to qualify for next season's Champions League. 
"Now we have to think about the league match against (bottom side) Palermo," Milan Chief Executive Adriano Galliani said Wednesday. 
"On Sunday we absolutely must not repeat last year's performance against Fiorentina, which came after the return match against Barcelona (in the Champions League)".
