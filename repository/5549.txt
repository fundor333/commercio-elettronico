    (ANSA) - New Delhi, March 14 - India on Thursday put on hold
the procedure for its new ambassador to Rome to take up his
position, amid rising tension over Italy's decision not to send
two marines accused of killing two Indian fisherman back after
they came home to vote, the PTI agency said.      The new ambassador, Basant Kumar Gupta, was scheduled to
leave for Rome on Friday.      Relations with Italy are being reviewed by India because of
the issue, the Indian foreign ministry has said.      The ministry has also summoned the EU's ambassador to New
Delhi to discuss the case.      Earlier on Thursday, India's Supreme Court told the Italian
ambassador to New Delhi Daniele Mancini he was not to leave the
country.     The marines - Massimiliano Lattore and Salvatore Girone -
have been charged with homicide for allegedly killing two
fishermen off the Kerala coast in February 2012 in an
anti-piracy operation. 
     Italy claims it has jurisdiction for the case as the
incident took place in international waters.      They pair, who were on bail but with an obligation to stay
in India, were allowed to return to Italy for four weeks for the
election.      The marines returned to India after being granted leave to
return for the Christmas holidays.
