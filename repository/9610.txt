    (ANSA) - Rome, March 14 - Pope Francis had the air of a man
who has always been pontiff during a visit to Rome's Santa Maria
Maggiore (St Mary Major) Basilica on Thursday, one of the
priests at the church said.      "It seemed like he has always been pope," Father Elio
Monteleone said of Francis, who visited one of Rome's most
important churches less than 24 hours after he had been elected
the new head of the world's 1.2 billion Catholics.      "He was not embarrassed or afraid. He greeted us all one by
one. He said some words to each one of us. 
     "He was very warm and very simple".
