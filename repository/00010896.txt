#titolo Berlusconi sex, Mediaset trials move to Brescia asked - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Milan, March 15 - Silvio Berlusconi's defence
lawyers on Friday asked for the ex-premier's two Milan trials to
be moved to the nearby city of Brescia on the grounds of alleged
bias by magistrates he says are persecuting him.     When a claim of so-called 'legitimate suspicion' of bias is 
upheld, a trial is moved to the nearest major city.     Berlusconi is on trial for alleged sex with an underage
prostitute called Ruby and appealing a four-year conviction for
tax fraud on film rights involving his Mediaset media group.     The three-time premier's People of Freedom (PdL) party
staged a controversial demonstration inside the Milan courthouse
on Monday and are planning another one to support claims the
alleged campaign of persecution has been stepped up after
Italy's recent general election.     The demo came after prosecutors asked for checks that an eye
problem which sent the ex-premier to hospital was valid proof of
his inability to attend hearings.     A poll Friday said a third of Italians agree with the media
tycoon's claim that allegedly left-wing magistrates have been
trying to hound him out of politics since he became premier in
1994.
