#titolo EU refuses to comment on Italy-India marines dispute - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Brussels, March 15 - European Union officials on
Friday refused to be drawn on the dispute between India and
Italy over Rome's decision not to return two marines for trial
on murder charges, saying only "no comment". 
     Spokesmen for High Representative of the Union for
Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Catherine Ashton also
declined to discuss what was said to the EU's ambassador to New
Delhi, Joao Cravino, who was summoned to the Indian foreign
ministry Thursday.      On Thursday India's Supreme Court slapped a travel ban on
Italian ambassador to New Delhi, Daniele Mancini, until March 19
after Rome said it would not return Massimilano Latorre and
Salvatore Girone for trial following the expiry of a four-week
permit issued to the pair to allow them to return home to take
part in February's elections. 
     The marines face charges of homicide in India after
allegedly shooting and killing two Indian fisherman during an
anti-piracy mission in February 2012. 
     The Italian government has always denied that India has
jurisdiction over the matter, as the incident took place in
international waters off the Kerala coast.      In its letter to the Italian ambassador, the Indian Supreme
Court said Mancini "violated" a "sworn declaration"
presented on February 9 to the Indian government as "a
guarantee of the marines' return".      Along with the order to not leave the country, the Supreme
Court ordered the ambassador to offer explanations for Italy's
actions by March 18.
