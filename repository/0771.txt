#titolo Lombardi hopes topless activists 'don't catch cold' - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Vatican City, March 13 - Vatican spokesman Father
Federico Lombardi said on Wednesday that he hoped the women
protesters who stripped off their shirts outside St Peter's at
the start of the conclave "don't catch a cold".       One woman from the Ukraine-based feminist group FEMEN was
detained by police for demonstrating topless in front of the
Vatican on Tuesday.      "Pope no more!" she shouted as police carried her away.      Lombardi told journalists at a press conference on
Wednesday that he doubted the crowds gathered waiting to see
white smoke signalling the election of a new pope paid much mind
to the bare-chested activists.      "Seems to me the people on the square are more concentrated
on (watching for) smoke," he said.
