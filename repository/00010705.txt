#titolo Arrests in new Lombardy health probe - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Milan, March 12 - Some 20 people have been formally
placed under investigation in relation to alleged corruption
linked to health-sector contracts in the northern Lombardy
region, Milan prosecutors said Tuesday.      Seven people have also been arrested in connection with the
probe, including three businessmen belonging to a family that
owns a company specialising in hospital machinery, the former
editor of La Padania, the newspaper of the Northern League, and
former Lombardy regional councillor Massimo Guarischi. 
     Meanwhile, police have carried out over 50 searches in
Italy and abroad in connection with the probe.      Medical facilities involved in the investigations include
Milan's San Paolo hospital, the National Cancer Institute and
the Cremona local health authority. 
     The probe is the latest in a string of corruption scandals
involving the Lombardy regional administration that led the
former Lombardy governor Roberto Formigoni to dissolve his
executive last October. 
     Formigoni himself is suspected of wrongdoing related to
health-sector contracts in one of those cases.      He denied any wrongdoing.
