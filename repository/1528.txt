#titolo Cardinals return to the Sistine Chapel - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Vatican City, March 13 - The 115 cardinals
gathered to elect the successor of Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI
met again in the Sistine Chapel Wednesday morning as the second
day of voting began.      From Wednesday on, eligible cardinals will vote four times
daily until a candidate has a two-thirds majority in the
conclave - or 77 votes.      Black smoke rising from the chimney on the roof of the
Sistine Chapel on Tuesday evening indicated that the day's
voting was inconclusive.      Despite rain and chilly weather, crowds are gathered in St. Peter's square, waiting to see white smoke and hear the peal of
St. Peter's bells, which will announce a new pope has been
elected.
