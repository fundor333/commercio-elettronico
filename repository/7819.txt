#titolo Francis will visit Benedict, but not Friday or Saturday - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Vatican City, March 14 - Pope Francis will go to
the papal summer residence at Castel Gandolfo near Rome to see
his predecessor, Benedict XVI, but the visit will not take place
on Friday or Saturday, the Vatican said Thursday.      "Francis will go to Castel Gandolfo, not tomorrow or the
next day," said Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi. "As
soon as it is planned we'll let you know".      He will attend mass with the cardinals in the Sistine
Chapel later on Thursday. 
     He will then receive the cardinals at the Vatican's
Clementine Hall for a more informal meeting on Friday.      "No speeches are expected," said Lombardi. "It's an
opportunity to greet one another". 
     Francis will meet the media at the Vatican's Paul VI Hall 
at 11:00 Italian time on Saturday and give his first Angelus
address on Sunday. 
     The inaugural mass of Francis's papacy will start at 9:30
local time on Tuesday and it will take place in St Peter's
Square, weather permitting, Lombardi said.      He added that the general audience of the pope, which
usually takes place Wednesday, will not be held next week
because the faithful will have the opportunity to greet Francis
at the inaugural mass.
