#titolo Soccer: Sheikh al Qaddumi probed over failed Roma investment - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Rome, March 15 - A wealthy Middle Eastern investor,
Sheikh Adnan Adel Aref al Qaddumi, has been put under
investigation by Rome prosecutors after his bid to take up a
stake in Serie A side AS Roma failed, judicial sources said
Friday.      Last month the three-time Italian champions issued a
statement saying they had reached a preliminary deal with the
sheikh, who is reportedly from Jordon although mystery surrounds
his origins, to enter the club's ownership group.      But on Thursday Roma said a deadline had passed without al
Qaddumi coming up with the funds needed to invest in the club.      Media reports had said al Qaddumi was poised to invest 100
million euros.      This contributed to the club's share price soaring before
it came back down when it became clear the deal was running into
trouble.      The sheikh is being probed for market rigging.
