#titolo Israel signs contact for Milan Expo - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Milan, March 13 - Israel has signed its
participation contract for Expo 2015 in Milan.      The deal sees the Mediterranean country take up a strategic
position for its pavilion at the exhibition site in an area
adjacent to the Italian pavilion. 
     The contract was inked Tuesday by Elazar Cohen, the
commissioner general of the Israeli Pavilion, and Expo 2015 CEO
Giuseppe Sala.      With Israel's signature, Expo Milano 2015 has now signed
participation contracts with 35 of the 123 countries that have
so far committed themselves to taking part.      The theme of the Expo, 'Feeding the Planet - Energy for
Life', centers on fighting famine and malnutrition worldwide
through sustainable development, global cooperation and new
technology.      Israel has a big contribution to make as it is a pioneer 
in the fields of agriculture and effective water management,
which is crucial to be able to grow food on its largely arid
terrain.  
     "The outstanding innovative expertise of Israel in the
field of technology for agriculture in arid areas undoubtedly
represents a huge added value for the development of the Expo's
theme," said Sala. 
     "This signature seals a partnership that will provide a
continuous and fruitful dialogue between all the protagonists of
Expo Milano 2015. 
     "Each country is asked to share its knowledge and
excellence in order to help solve the food and environmental
emergencies which are afflicting the planet".
