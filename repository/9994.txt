#titolo Benedict to stay in Castel Gandolfo summer home - ANSA English
(ANSA) - Vatican City - Benedict XVI will stay at the pontifical summer residence at Castel Gandolfo outside Rome before moving into a Vatican monastery after he has officially stepped down, the Church has announced. 
 "When renovation work on the monastery of cloistered nuns inside the Vatican is complete, the Holy Father will move there for a period of prayer and reflection," said Vatican Spokesman Federico Lombardi. 
Benedict, 85, announced Monday he would resign at the end of the month due to his age, becoming the first pontiff in roughly six centuries to step down from the lifetime term. 
 The lakeside residence is equipped with a swimming pool that was used for physiotherapy treatments during his predecessor John Paul II's bout with Parkinson's. 
 NEW TITLE FOR RETIRING POPE 
 Lombardi said Tuesday a new title may have to be coined to refer to Pope Benedict XVI once he officially steps down. 
 "Perhaps Bishop Emeritus of Rome," he said. 
 "It will be interesting to see how we address him, how he will be called," said Lombardi. "It will be difficult to call him cardinal". 
 Benedict will retain his rank as bishop after his resignation becomes effective. 
 PAPAL RING TO BE 'TERMINATED' 
 Lombardi added that Benedict XVI's papal ring will be "terminated" following his resignation. 
 The spokesman said the symbol of the papacy will likely be broken, but he stressed that experts were working to determine proper etiquette. 
 Known as the Fisherman's Ring, the golden symbol of papal power shows St Peter fishing. 
 According to Lombardi, "objects strictly tied to the ministry of St Peter must be destroyed".
