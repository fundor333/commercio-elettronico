#titolo New pope took name in honour of St Francis of Assisi - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Rome, March 14 - The new pope took the name Francis
to honour Saint Francis of Assisi, according to American
Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the archbishop of New York.      There had been speculation that the pontiff may have become
the first pope to take the name Francis as a tribute to Francis
Xavier, a 16th-century Spanish saint and co-founder of the
Jesuits order that the newly elected pope belongs to.      But Dolan said Francis I has revealed this is not the case
to the cardinals who elected him at the conclave.      "The pope told us that he chose the name Francis in honour
of Francis of Assisi," Dolan told reporters.       "St Francis took care of the poor and humble and this will
be his job".
