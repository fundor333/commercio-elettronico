#titolo Bavarian minister accuses Italy of immigrant dumping - ANSA English
(ANSA) - Berlin, March 15 - Bavarian Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann accused Italy on Friday of dumping illegal immigrants on other Schengen countries.       Hermann called Italy's behavior "brazen", and accused Italian authorities of pushing out undocumented North African immigrants by handing them temporary visas for the Schengen area and "even 500 euros to make them leave Italy", the German press agency DPA reported. 
The Bavarian minister called on German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle to remedy the problem at the European level. 
Herrmann's complaints came after German police stopped six African and Iraqi immigrants on an Italian bus headed for Germany along Austria's Inntal expressway.       "Since the beginning of March, (German) agents have come across another 120 similar cases," added a spokesperson for police in Rosenheim, a town on Bavaria's border with Austria.
