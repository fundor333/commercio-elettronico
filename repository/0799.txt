#titolo New parliament hails Pope Francis - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Rome, March 15 - Members of both houses of Italy's
parliament applauded Pope Francis during the opening session on
Friday following his recent election as the new leader of the
Roman Catholic Church and Bishop of Rome.       Most senators rose to their feet as Emilio Colombo, acting
Senate Speaker, wished the new Argentinian pope a ''fruitful
pontificate'', although many members of the anti-establishment
5-Star Movement (M5S) of comedian Beppe Grillo reportedly
remained in their seats.      Earlier in the morning the provisional Speaker of the
Chamber, Antonio Leone, described Francis' election as successor
to Benedict XVI as ''a moment of intense emotion and high
expectations'', drawing similar applause.
