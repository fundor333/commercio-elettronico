#titolo Center-left MPs slam Thorne's pro-M5S speech to students - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Rome, March 13 - Center-left MPs on Wednesday
slammed US Ambassador David Thorne's speech to Roman high school
students in which he held up rabble-rousing comic Beppe Grillo's
anti-establishment 5-Star Movement (M5S) as an example to
follow.      The M5S rose a huge protest vote in the recent general
election to become the single biggest party in the House and
hold the balance of power in the Senate.  
     ''You can take your country in hand and act, like the
5-Star Movement, for reform and change'', Thorne told students
at Rome's Visconti high school earlier today.      ''If confirmed, the ambassador's speech would be tantamount
to grave interference in Italian affairs'', said newly elected
MP Michele Anzaldi, who is from the Democratic Party (PD). He
went on to call on Foreign Minister Giulio Terzi to demand an
explanation from the US State Department.      ''Thorne's comments were misplaced and made with deplorable
levity'', newly elected MP Rosa Maria Di Giorgi (PD) echoed him. ''If confirmed, Thorne's words amount to a diplomatic incident. I hope the US State Department will immediately distance itself
from the ambassador's statement''.     ''The US Embassy does not support any political party. It
dialogues with everyone and supports the use of social media as
a tool for change'', the US embassy tweeted in response. 
    ''My words have sparked interest. New media use is positive
for the Italian political system'', Thorne himself tweeted,
while Grillo proudly posted the ambassador's speech on his blog.
