#titolo Alitalia pilots' unions call for 24-hour strike on march 22 - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Rome, March 12 - Some of Italian airline Alitalia's
pilots are staging a 24-hour strike on Friday, March 22.      The striking pilots belong to the Filt-Cgil, Fit-Cisl,,
Uiltrasporti and Ugl unions and follows a four strike which took
place January 25.      In a statement, the unions said the decision to call a
strike follows the "fruitless" results of talks with company
management over the "no longer sustainable critical issues
facing pilots of Gruppo Alitalia companies".      Among the issues highlighted by the unions is the company's
strategy of subcontracting certain flights to other companies
and the "partial and incomplete application" of agreements
regarding hiring and personnel training.      Despite a state-backed rescue operation in 2008-09,
Alitalia - which was merged with domestic rival AirOne - remains
loss making.      The company - which includes Air France as a minority
shareholder - recently appointed a new chief executive as part
of continuing efforts to restructure into a profitable carrier.
