#titolo Argentinian Bergoglio elected pope - ANSA English
(ANSA) - Vatican City, March 13 - Buenos Aires Archbishop Jorge Mario Bergoglio was elected pope Wednesday. Bergoglio, 76, is the first Jesuit pope.       A conservative like his predecessor Benedict XVI and a strong supporter of helping the poor, he becomes Pope Francis I.       In his first words on the balcony of St Peter's, he said the cardinals who elected him had chosen someone "from the end of the Earth". 
Â Francis has so far lived in a modest flat and clipped his own nails. 
He is the 266th pope and leader of the world's 1.2 billion Catholics.
