#titolo Italian public debt hits new high, 2.023 tn euros - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Rome, March 15 - Italy's public debt, the largest
in the eurozone after Greece's, hit a new high of 2,022.7
billion euros in January, 34 billion up on December, the Bank of
Italy said Friday.     The sum includes 43 billion euros given to Italy by the
eurozone's new permanent bailout fund, the European Stability
Mechanism (ESM), the central bank said.     At the end of last year the debt dipped back below two
trillion for the first time in more than a year, at 1,988.363
billion euros.     The debt, the main reason Italy has been exposed to the euro
crisis, rose last year from around 120% to 126% of GDP despite
government cost-cutting.     According to commitments with Europe, Italy must cut the
debt to 60% of GDP within 20 years.
