     (ANSA) - Vatican City, March 18 - Hundreds of volunteers
from Unitalsi, the association for ill and disabled Catholics,
will be in and around St Peter's Square on Tuesday to assist
those in need for the inauguration of Pope Francis, the
association president Salvatore Pagliuca said Monday.       "There will be about 600 volunteers assisting all people
with disabilities tomorrow," Pagliuca announced.       Five specially equipped vehicles will also be available at
different stations hosted by Unitalsi to shuttle visitors from
the nearby Piazza Risorgimento, Castel Sant'Angelo and to St
Peter's and back.       As with past events at the Vatican the association is
"ready to receive and attend to a neighbor in need, with more
than 110 years of experience (of helping)," Pagliuca said.
