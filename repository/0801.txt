#titolo New Delhi 'firmly disapproves' of marines staying in Italy - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - New Delhi, March 12 - India on Tuesday expressed
its "firm disapproval" of Italy's decision not to send back to
trial in India two anti-piracy marines accused of homicide there
in 2012. 
     On Monday the Italian government announced that
Massimiliano Latorre and Salvatore Girone, accused of killing
two Indian fishermen, would not be returning when a four-week
permit to exercise their right to vote in last month's general
elections expired. 
     India's response Tuesday came after the Italian ambassador
to New Delhi, Daniele Mancini, was summoned by the Indian
foreign ministry to explain Italy's decision. 
     In a statement, the Italian foreign ministry has said that
"the conduct of Indian authorities violated international
rights" by detaining them for over a year. 
     Italy has also expressed openness to the possible
intervention of an international arbitrator in the case.
