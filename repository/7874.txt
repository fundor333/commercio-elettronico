#titolo Anti-mafia writer Saviano visits 'friend' Julian Assange - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Rome, March 18 - Italian writer and anti-mafia
campaigner Roberto Saviano was in London this weekend spending
time with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange at the Ecuadorean
embassy. 
     "In London, I went to visit a friend of mine," said Saviano
on Twitter on Saturday. "With Julian...in spite of everything,
we can't stop laughing," he tweeted again on Sunday along with a
picture of the two smiling and embracing. 
     Assange was granted asylum at the embassy while he faces
extradition to Sweden for rape charges. 
     He has said he fears being subsequently extradited to the
U.S., where he could be prosecuted for a series of embarrassing
diplomatic cables published by WikiLeaks in 2010. 
     Saviano is best known for his 2006 best-seller Gomorrah,
which led to death threats and round-the-clock police
protection.      It was turned into a critically acclaimed film which won
second prize at Cannes and five European Film Awards in 2008.
