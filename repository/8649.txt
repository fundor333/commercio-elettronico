    (ANSA) - Rome, March 18 - Ex-premier Silvio Berlusconi on
Monday told MPs for his People of Freedom (PdL) party that he
expects the centre left to hand-pick the next Italian president,
rather than finding a consensus candidate.      He added that the PdL will "battle" against this "in
parliament" and "in the streets", sources at Monday's meeting
with the MPs said.      At the weekend the centre left, which came first in last
month's general election but failed to win a majority in the
Upper House, managed to get both its candidates elected as
Speakers for the House and Senate, Italy's third- and
second-highest institutional roles respectively behind the
president.      Centre-left leader Pier Luigi Bersani is trying to reach
out to Beppe Grillo's anti-establishment 5-Star Movement to find
some sort of arrangement to govern Italy, but he has ruled out
cooperating with Berlusconi.      The new parliament is set to start electing a new head of
state next month.      President Giorgio Napolitano's seven-year term ends in May.
