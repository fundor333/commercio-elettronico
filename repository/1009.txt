     (ANSA) - Rome, March 14 - A Somali pirate attack on an
Italian merchant ship sailing Thursday from Djibouti to Oman was
thwarted by marines, an Italian Navy spokesman said.      Six pirates driving speedboats attempted to board the
vessel sailing near the Gulf of Aden when they were spotted by
an offshore patrol boat.      A navy spokesman said that "neither the crew nor ship have
reported damage and the ship is now out of danger".
