#titolo Italy foreign minister says position on marines 'very solid' - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Jerusalem, March 14 - Italian Foreign Minister
Giulio Terzi on Thursday said Italy's decision to not return to
India two marines accused of killing two Indian fishermen last
year is based on a "very solid" position.      "We have a very solid position, of which we are perfectly
convinced, (as are) many important partners in the international
community, (based on) the fact that we are acting in full
respect of international law," Terzi said from Jerusalem, where
he is on a diplomatic mission to meet Israeli political leaders.      The Italian foreign minister was referring to the Indian
Supreme Court's letter earlier Thursday to the Italian
ambassador in New Delhi which accused him of "violating" a
promise that the two marines - granted a one month permit to
leave India in February to vote in Italy's recent national
elections - would be returned to India.      However asked to comment specifically on the letter
delivered to Italy's ambassador, Terzi only said: "I won't enter
into the details".
