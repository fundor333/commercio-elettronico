     (ANSA) - ALESSANDRIA - The Capanne di Cosola,  the highest
pass in the Apennines, is in the area known as the 'four
provinces' because it marks the meeting point of Piedmont,
Lombardy and Emilia, with Liguria just a few kilometres away. The climb to the ridge that runs along the border of Piedmont
and Emilia leading to Mt Legna (1,699 metres' altitude) offers a
spectacular view of the landscape.    The trail, which can be explored with cross-country skis or
with snow shoes, follows the Via del Mare for a bit, the long
tourist hiking trail linking Tortona to Portofino. 
   From Serravalle Scrivia (Alessandria) cross through the
Borbera Valley and after Cabella Ligure you reach the Capanne di
Cosola pass. Park the car and you will see the trail a few
metres away, passing alongside a bowling green. Follow the path,
which leads through typical Apennine woods and along the grassy
ridge, alongside animal enclosures, until reaching Mt. Cavalmurone at 1670 metres' altitude. 
   The route then continues along the ridge, rising and falling
beside a natural wall of Karst rock until coming to the summit,
after which you descend into the pass below. Leave the trail and
a few metres off to your right will lead you to the peak of Mt
Legna at 1669 metres' altitude. The return follows the same
route in reverse, with the total trip taking around an hour and
rising over an altitude of 250 metres. (ANSA).
