     (ANSA) - Malgrate, March 13 - The cousin of the Archbishop of
Milan Angelo Scola was struck by emotion after white smoke blew
from the Sistine Chapel, indicating that the conclave has
elected a new pope.      Italian cardinal Scola was one of the favourites to be
Benedict XVI's successor before the conclave.      "Oh God. It's white. It's white," said Chiara Colombo, who
lives in his home town of Malgrate, near Lecco. 
     "Now I'm going to cry. I can't hold back the tears".
