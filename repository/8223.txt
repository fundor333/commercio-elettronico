#titolo Italian centre left may reconsider public-funding proposal - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Rome, March 12 - Centre-left leader Pier Luigi
Bersani on Tuesday opened to the possibility of reviewing his
coalition's proposal on public funding for political parties in
a bid to form a new government.      "We are very ready to discuss our proposal on the review of
public funding but we are not of the idea that politics is just
for billionaires," Bersani told state broadcaster RAI. 
     "We are talking about a new logic using small private
funds, but this does not go far enough: what is needed is a law
regulating the transparency of parties' inner workings," he
said. 
     Bersani's comments came in response to a challenge by
former comedian Beppe Grillo, leader of the anti-establishment
5-Star Movement (M5S) that took 163 seats in recent
parliamentary elections, to his centre-left Democratic Party
(Pd) to commit to renouncing public funding like his grass-roots
movement. 
     The centre-left coalition came first in last month's
election but failed to win a working majority in the Senate
after ex-premier Silvio Berlusconi's centre right arrived a
close second and M5S captured a huge protest vote.      Pd representatives are currently exploring the possibility
of obtaining M5S support for at least some of its government
proposals, although Grillo has repeatedly ruled out voting
confidence in a Bersani-led executive.
