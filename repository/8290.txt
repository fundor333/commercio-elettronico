#titolo Pope visits cardinal in hospital, blesses patients - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Rome, March 15 - Pope Francis surprised patients
and staff at a Rome hospital Friday when he came to visit a
cardinal there. 
     Francis, who on Wednesday was elevated to the throne of St
Peter, arrived with a small security entourage at the Paul XI
clinic to see Argentine Cardinal Jorge Maria Mejia, who was
recovering from a fainting spell. 
     "He entered to a round of applause from the patients and
the staff," said Sister Marina, director of the clinic. "He went
up to intensive care and had a private visit with the cardinal. There were three other patients there, and (the pope) blessed
each of them. He then greeted a crowd of people in the lobby
with a lot of compassion".
