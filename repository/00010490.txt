#titolo Rome's Jewish community wishes Francis I well - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Rome, March 13 - Rome's Chief Rabbi Riccardo Di
Segni on Wednesday send his best wishes to newly elected Pope
Francis I on behalf of the city's Jewish community.      "I express my best wishes to Jorge Mario Bergoglio, who has
been elected Francis I, so that he can lead the Catholic Church
with strength and wisdom in the coming years," Di Segni said.      "The Church's relationship with Rome's Jewish Community and
its dialogue with Judaism have made important steps (forward).      "The hope is that it is possible to continue on a path of
continuity and good relations".      Relations between the Vatican and the Jewish world were
strained somewhat during the papacy of Francis's predecessor
Benedict XVI, who rehabilitated an ultra-conservative cleric who
turned out to have denied the scope of the Holocaust.
