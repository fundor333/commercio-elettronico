#titolo Naples 'City of Science' to reopen April 13 - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Naples, March 13 - Naples City of Science cultural
attraction, gutted by suspected arson last week, will reopen
partially on April 13, the site's president, Vittorio
Silvestrini, said Wednesday.     A section for children would be one of the first to reopen,
he said.     On Tuesday traces of gasoline were found at the site.     At least six samples were found in four different locations
at the site, which went up in flames late last Monday.     The complex was considered one of Naples' cultural gems.     It featured a large interactive science museum that
attracted around 350,000 visitors each year and it also had
facilities for conferences and other educational activities.     Only one of the complex's buildings was untouched by the
flames.     The mayor of Naples, Luigi de Magistris, has openly
suspected mafia foul play.
