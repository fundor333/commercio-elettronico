     (ANSA) - Vatican City, March 15 - Pope Francis almost took a
tumble during a meeting with cardinals in the Vatican Friday.    The new Argentine pontiff tripped as he was going down from a
dais in the Clementine Hall but regained his balance.    He then embraced the dean of the College of Cardinals, Angelo
Sodano, who was coming to meet him.
