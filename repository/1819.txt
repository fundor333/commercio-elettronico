#titolo Conclave black smoke 'not a sign of division' - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Vatican City, March 13 - The first three inclusive
votes in the conclave to elect a new pope which resulted in two
gusts of black smoke from the Sistine Chapel are "not a sign of
division" among the cardinal-electors, Vatican Spokesman Father
Federico Lombardi said Wednesday.     Lombardi recalled that only Pope Pius XII had been elected
so swiftly, after three votes, in 1939.     Black smoke from the Sistine chimney means no agreement,
while white smoke is the signal that cardinals will have chosen
the 266th pope after Benedict XVi's shock abdication last month.
