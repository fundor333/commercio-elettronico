#titolo Pope Francis sparks Rome travel boom from native Argentina - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Rome, March 15 - The number of Argentines looking
for hotels in Rome has shot up by 37% since Buenos Aires
Archbishop Jorge Mario Bergoglio was elevated to the papacy on
Wednesday, according to Hotels.com. 
     "The election of the new pope is certainly an event that's
prompting a lot of the faithful to take a trip to Rome in the
coming weeks," said Kate Hopcraft, spokeswoman for the online
bookings site. 
     "Specifically we expect Argentinians to be anxious to see
up close the first South American pontiff in history, and data
from the first two days since his election confirm it". 
     Francis, known for shunning largesse, has asked people
planning to visit him to give the money to the poor instead,
just as he did in 2001 when he was named a cardinal in Rome.
