#titolo 8 Turin council officials probed - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Turin, March 12 - Eight managers and staff on the
Turin city council were placed under investigation Tuesday in
connection with suspected graft in concessions in a popular
riverside night-life district in the northern Italian city.     Police said the eight are suspected of irregularities in
granting concessions and levying fees.     The probe stems from one opened last summer after complaints
about noise in the Murazzi district on the side of the River Po.
