#titolo PD vows blank ballots in speaker elections - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Rome, March 14 - Comedian Beppe Grillo's
anti-establishment 5-Star Movement (M5S) reiterated on Thursday
it would not make a deal with the centre-left Democratic Party
(PD) on parliamentary speakers to be voted in on Friday.       PD leader Pier Luigi Bersani insisted he was still open to
talks and called on his deputies to cast blank ballots on
Friday.      "This decision reflects the will of the PD to try in every
possible way and at every possible turn to find a more shared
solution," said Luigi Zanda, PD deputy head and mediator.       Thursday evening Bersani gathered with his deputies behind
closed doors as tensions and divisions within the PD are
reported to be rising, with supporters of Bersani rival Matteo
Renzi agitating on the one hand, while others disagree with the
line of holding out for an alliance with M5S at any cost.       
      Supporters of ex-premier Mario Monti, led by Linda
Lanzillotta, are for creating a different, temporary coalition -
even with the Silvio Berlusconi's People of Freedom (PdL) party
- with a brief, limited mandate to pass electoral reform and
slash the number of parliamentarians.       Meanwhile the M5S is hoping for defections toward M5S
speaker candidates, presented late Thursday, without having made
any commitments toward the formation of a shared government.       The M5S presented candidates for Senate and Chamber
speakers - Luis Alberto Orellana and Roberto Fico, respectively
- after saying it would vote for them "without outside
influence".      "A jump into the dark is better than an intellectually
assisted suicide," Beppe Grillo tweeted late Thursday, making
reference to an article hosted on his blog that invites the M5S
to not "listen to the sirens" of the Democratic Party.      "By now we are at war and if we die, we will do so on the
battle fed of the next elections," Grillo added.
