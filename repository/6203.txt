#titolo Bersani blasts Grillo's claim Italy already out of euro - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Rome, March 14 - Centre-left leader Pier Luigi
Bersani on Thursday blasted 5-Star Movement (M5S) leader Beppe
Grillo for claiming that Italy is already effectively out of the
euro.      But Bersani added that if Grillo, who wants to have a
referendum on whether Italy should keep the euro as its
currency, were right it would mean the country faces a "disaster
of cosmic proportions".      The two leaders have been sparring with Grillo knocking
back Bersani's attempts to lure his anti-establishment movement
into a post-election pact.      Bersani's centre-left alliance came first in last month's
general election but it failed to win a majority in parliament
and the M5S holds the balance of power after capturing a huge
protest vote.      Grillo told German business daily Handelsblatt that: "Italy
is de facto already out of the euro. The country is on its
knees".      "The northern European countries are only holding onto us
until their banks have reclaimed their investments in Italian
sovereign bonds," the comedian-turned-politician said. "Then
they'll drop us like a hot potato". 
     Bersani blasted the comments.      "It's not the greatest thing in the world for someone to go
and tell a German newspaper that we are already out of the
euro," he told his Democratic Party's in-house TV channel.      "It means that we are going around with waste paper in our
pockets, with a disaster of cosmic proportions (in store) for
this country".
