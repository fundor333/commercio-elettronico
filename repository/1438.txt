#titolo Pope says conclave 'delicate but meaningful for all' - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Vatican City, March 15 - The recent conclave was
''charged with meaning not just for the College of Cardinals but
for all the faithful'', the newly elected Pope Francis said on
Friday.      ''We had a marked sense of the affection and solidarity of
the universal Church, as well as the attention of many people
who do not share our faith but who look with respect and
admiration on the Church and the Holy See,'' continued the
Argentine pope.      Francis also expressed his gratitude to Christians all over
the world and to the crowd that gathered in St Peter's Square to
witness his election as Benedict XVI's successor Wednesday for
their ''touching and intense spiritual closeness''.
