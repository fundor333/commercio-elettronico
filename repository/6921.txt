#titolo Vatileaks report available to pope, but likely not read yet - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Rome, March 18 - The hefty Vatileaks dossier is
"available" for Pope Francis to review, but the newly elected
pontiff likely has "other matters to attend to" during his first
days in office, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said
on Monday.        "I would be very surprised if he has dedicated time to
reading it these last few days," Lombardi said at a press
conference.       Francis' predecessor Benedict XVI commissioned three elder
cardinals to compile a report on the so-called Vatileaks
scandal, which saw the pope's ex-butler convicted of stealing
and leaking confidential Vatican papers last year.      The result, a 300-page, two-volume dossier, was presented
to Benedict last fall. Photo: Benedict with ex-butler Paolo Gabriele
