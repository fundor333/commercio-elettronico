#titolo PD, M5S mediators hold 'positive meeting' - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Rome, March 12 - Despite "mediation" talks Tuesday
between the 5-Star Movement (M5S) of comedian Beppe Grillo and
the Democratic Party (PD) led by Pier Luigi Bersani, the two
groups appeared to remain distant on certain key issues.      Contrasting statements on the part of participants in the
talks on the issue of who will be assigned the presidency of the
lower house of parliament seemed to cast doubt on the talks'
success.      After the talks, the head of the M5S's caucus in the lower
house said that she expected the presidency of the chamber would
be offered to her group, given it is the largest single group in
the chamber.      "We are the largest political force in the House, so we
expect that the citizens' vote will be respected," Roberta
Lombardi said.      However, Luigi Zanda, one of the three "mediators" for the
PD in the cross-party talks Tuesday who described a "positive
meeting in which the primary objectives and the need to
jump-start the Parliament were shared," said that the M5S had
not asked for the presidency.      Zanda also said that his party would hold talks with the
other main political forces regarding institutional roles later
Tuesday evening.      "Tonight at 7:30 pm we will meet the PdL (People of Freedom
party) and we have contact with Civic Choice to meet and
Thursday morning we will meet the Northern League and then draw
conclusions with the center-left coalition," Zanda said.      Civic Choice is the centrist coalition led by Mario Monti.      Meanwhile, later Thursday Lombardi said in a video posted
on the movement's website that the M5S would announce its
candidates for presidency of both the Senate and House by
Wednesday evening.
