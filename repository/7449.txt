#titolo Italian antitrust promotes conflict-of-interest measures - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Rome, March 18 - The Italian antitrust authority
told the parliament on Monday it should consider laws on
conflicts of interest for the sake of the country's image.      "Revisiting the current protocol regarding conflicts of
interest could improve the workings of institutions and the
image of the country abroad," said a report. 
     There has been talk of a conflict-of-interest law ever
since former premier Silvio Berlusconi, who owns Italy's three
biggest commercial TV channels as well as its largest publishing
group, entered politics in 1994 and swept to victory with his
then Forza Italia (Go Italy!) party. 
     Observers have noted there is already a clause in voting
rules declaring ineligible anyone with a State concession - a
provision that has not been applied to Berlusconi so far. 
     But both the center-left Democratic Party (PD) and the
anti-establishment 5-Star Movement (M5S) have vowed to implement
it, unless Berlusconi is not blocked from taking office by one
of his trials. 
     Berlusconi is appealing a four-year tax-fraud sentence for
film rights bought by his Mediaset group and a one-year term for
publishing an illegally obtained wiretap, while he faces trial
for allegedly paying a Senator to switch sides in 2006.      Berlusconi, leader of the center-right People of Freedom's
party, on Monday said Italy's new government shouldn't worry
itself with a conflict of interest law, but should concentrate
on the economy.
