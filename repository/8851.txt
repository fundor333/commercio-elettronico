#titolo Pope Francis shunning perks and pomp of new office - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Vatican City, March 14 - Pope Francis is shunning
the perks and pomp of office like the saint he took his name
from.      He waved off the "solemn" pontifical car laid on after he
became pope Wednesday night and insisted on going back to the
cardinals' residence in a minibus with the former colleagues who
had just elected him, Vatican Spokesman Father Federico Lombardi
told reporters Thursday. 
     When he left his hotel Thursday morning, Lombardi added,
"He paid his bill to set a good example".      As Archbishop Jorge Mario Bergoglio in Buenos Aires, the
new pope was known for living in a modest flat and using public
transport. 
     Pope watchers have also noted Francis is not wearing a new
golden papal cross around his neck, keeping his simple, small
silver one, and has eschewed the dainty red shoes sported by his
predecessor Benedict XVI.      Francis, who became the first non-European pope in 1,300
years after Benedict's shock abdication last month, has said he
chose his name to recall St Francis, the 13th-century former
nobleman and founder of the Franciscan order who wore a simple
cassock instead of the grand robes of other orders, living in
poverty and tending to the poor.
