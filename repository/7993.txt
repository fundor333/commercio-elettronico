#titolo Monti asks EU leaders to reflect on 'Italian case' - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Brussels, March 14 - Outgoing Premier Mario Monti
said that he would invite European leaders to reflect on Italy
and its post-electoral impasse during summit meetings in
Brussels Thursday and Friday.      "I will ask them to reflect both on the positives and
negatives because the Italian case itself calls for reflection
in general," Monti said during his last appearance at an EU
summit as Italian premier.      Following the country's February 24-25 general election
Monti warned that there is a danger populism in Italy that could
derail the EU integration course.      Pier Luigi Bersani's centre-left alliance came first in the
elections, but failed to win a working majority in the Senate
because of votes pulled by three-time premier Silvio
Berlusconi's centre right and the anti-establishment 5-Star
Movement (M5S) of comedian Beppe Grillo.      Both Berlusconi and Grillo were accused of using populist
rhetoric in the election campaign.      Grillo, whose anti-establishment M5S rocked the political
establishment with a stunning show in the elections, has
proposed holding a referendum on whether Italy should stay in
the eurozone.
