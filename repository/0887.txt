#titolo Berlusconi says new govt should focus on economy - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Rome, March 18 - Silvio Berlusconi, leader of the
center-right People of Freedom's party, on Monday said Italy's
new government shouldn't worry itself with a conflict of
interest law, but should concentrate on the economy.      According to people who attended a meeting of the party's
members to elect a head of caucus in the Senate, Berlusconi
reportedly said: "What is needed is an economic recovery and
help to companies."
    Aside from brushing off talk of conflicts of interest, the
PdL leader also said the government needed to focus on reforming
taxes, justice and the costs of politics in Italy and said that
the PdL was now three points ahead of the rival, left-leaning
Democrat Party (PD), headed by Pier Luigi Bersani.      Meanwhile, touching on the complex question of electing a
new head of state to succeed current president, Giorgio
Napolitano - whose seven-year terms ends this month - Berlusconi
repeated calls for the next president to be directly elected.      Currently the head of state is elected by the Parliament. However the inconclusive results of February's national
elections means agreement on selecting a successor to Napolitano
will likely be complicated.     Concerned that a head of state chosen by the newly-elected
parliament - where the PD and comedian Beppe Grillo's 5-Star
Movement dominate - would likely be in contrast to his PdL
movement, Berlusconi reportedly said that should the left also
take the presidency, "we will react in the piazzas and in the
parliament."
     "The left hates us. Communists are always the same and they
don't understand that the only (possible) government for the
country is with us," Berlusconi reportedly said.
