#titolo Juncker calls M5S leader irresponsible - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Brussels, March 15 - The leader of the
anti-establishment 5-Star Movement (M5S), Beppe Grillo, has made
"extremely irresponsible promises", ex-Eurogroup head
Jean-Claude Juncker said on Friday.       Results from the Italian elections demonstrate a "clear
rejection of EU policy" and "a massive rejection of the
political class in Italy by Italians who believe in people who
pretend to love them but instead are simply cunning," Juncker
said.       Grillo, whose M5S rocked the political establishment with
a stunning show in the elections, has proposed holding a
referendum on whether Italy should stay in the eurozone.       Juncker criticised Grillo for promising Italians that they
could "work 20 hours a week and that all of their problems would
be solved by leaving the euro,".   
      "Italians believe in fairytales," he said.       He also pointed to ex-premier Silvio Berlusconi's grapple
for power by "promising to return taxes imposed by outgoing
Premier Mario Monti", if need be out of his own pocket, as
indicating Italians' "superficial evaluation" of the political
situation.
