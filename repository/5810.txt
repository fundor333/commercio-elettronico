#titolo No urgency to sell confiscated ILVA steel - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Taranto, March 18 - There is no "particular
urgency" to sell off steel and semi-finished products
sequestered from the troubled ILVA plant in southern Italy, a
Taranto court said on Monday.      The 1.7 million tonnes of steel valued at one billion euros
is being held pending a Constitutional Court ruling on the fate
of the plant slated for April 9.      The facility has been at the center of a legal dispute
between local prosecutors, who have called for its closure, and
the national government, which has battled to keep it open to
save jobs and expertise.      The ILVA affair dates back to last summer.      A Taranto judge shut down the plant's smelters in July to
protect the health of workers and nearby residents from toxic
emissions found to have caused illnesses and deaths over a
period of years.      In October, the court also seized control of products
sitting in the docks, waiting to be commercialized, and issued a
new wave of arrests in a corruption probe linked to the ongoing
pollution probe.
