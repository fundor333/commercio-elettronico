#titolo Pope Francis missing part of lung, Vatican confirms - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Vatican City, March 14 - The Vatican on Thursday
confirmed that Pope Francis lost part of his lung in an
operation as a young man as concerns have been raised over his
health. 
     "I confirm that he had his lung operated on and had part of
it removed many years ago," said Vatican spokesman Father
Federico Lombardi. "But everyone has always seen him in good
health. Two of his colleagues from Argentina confirm that. I
believe he was 21 when it happened".      Concerns surfaced over the 76-year-old pontiff's health
shortly after he was elected pope Wednesday when reports
surfaced that an infection in his teens required excising a
large part of his lung.
