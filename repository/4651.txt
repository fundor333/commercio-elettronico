#titolo Italy indicted in Court of Justice over Lazio trash - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Rome, March 15 - Italy has been indicted in the
European Court of Justice for the "situation of waste management
in the Lazio region" around Rome, the environment ministry
announced Friday. 
     Environment Minister Corrado Clini called the move
"inevitable". 
     Last fall he warned that rubbish could start piling up in
Rome's streets in a crisis reminiscent of the problems Naples
has had in recent years if a new dump site is not found. 
     The Italian capital has been on the verge of having trash
problems for some time with its huge dump at Malagrotta filled
to well beyond capacity and local administrators, environmental
groups and residents unable to agree on an alternative.
