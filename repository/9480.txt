#titolo Grillo invites Berlusconi to become a fugitive - ANSA English

    (ANSA) - Rome, March 12 - Beppe Grillo, the leader of the
anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, on Tuesday invited Silvio
Berlusconi to become a fugitive of justice, saying this would be
better for the health of Italy and the ex-premier.      Berlusconi, who is currently in hospital with an eye
problem, recently said he feared magistrates wanted him to meet
the same fate as another former premier, Bettino Craxi, who died
in Tunisia in 2000 after fleeing the country following
corruption scandals.      Berlusconi is on trial in Milan for allegedly paying for
sex with an underage prostitute called Ruby and he has been
given two separate prison sentences in recent months for fraud
at his Mediaset empire and involvement in the publication of an
illegally obtained wiretap.      Naples prosecutors have also requested the 76-year-old
media magnate be indicted for allegedly bribing a Senator to
change political colours and help bring down Roman Prodi's
2006-2008 centre-left government.      "Berlusconi is scared of ending up like Craxi, but in
reality it would be lucky for him," Grillo, whose movement holds
the balance of power in parliament after a spectacular showing
in last month's general election, said on his blog.      "He could escape to Tunisian beaches full of Rubies without
having the daily ball-breaking of the magistrates.      "He should let himself get arrested as soon as possible
without any extenuating circumstances and take flight before the
arrest.       "He will gain in health terms. He will heal from his
uveitis (an irritation and swelling of the uvea, the middle
layer of the eye) and the Italians will finally heal from the
orchitis that he has inflicted on them for 20 years".       Orchitis is an inflammation of the testicles.
