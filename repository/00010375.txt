    (ANSA) - Rome, March 15 - The Italian government said Friday
it is working towards an "amicable settlement with India" in the
dispute over two Italian marines accused of killing two Indian
fishermen off the coast of Kerala.      The Italian anti-piracy sharpshooters are charged with
shooting and killing on February 15 last year Indian fishermen
Jelestine Valentine and Ajesh Binki from the oil tanker Enrica
Lexie, which they were guarding. 
     A diplomatic row between Rome and New Delhi has intensified
after Italy's decision not to send them back after a trip home
to vote in February's general election.      United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon on Friday
called for a "peaceful resolution and respect for international
law" in the dispute.      In a statement, the Italian government said it was pushing
for the application on international law, "as expressly
advocated by Ban Ki-moon".
