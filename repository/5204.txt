#titolo Turin judge convicts 6 ex-Teksid managers in asbestos case - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Turin, March 15 - A judge in the northern Italian
city of Turin convicted six ex-managers of Teksid, a leading
iron-castings maker for the automotive industry, on charges
related to the deaths and illnesses of workers presumed to be
due to asbestos exposure at Teksid's Turin facilities.      Fifteen ex-employees have died and another two have become
ill due to mesothelioma, a rare cancer found to be linked to
asbestos-exposure, or other tumors.      The judge blamed the ex-managers for suction systems in the
Turin facilities that were not up to norm, which may have caused
asbestos exposure during the 1978-1989 period.      The six ex-managers received prison sentences ranging from
one to five years.
