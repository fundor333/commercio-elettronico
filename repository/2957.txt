#titolo Italian ambassador has 'lost' immunity, says Indian court - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - New Delhi, March 18 - The Supreme Court in New
Delhi on Monday extended its order for Italian Ambassador
Daniele Mancini to stay in Indian territory in a dispute over
two Italian marines accused of killing two Indian fishermen off
the coast of Kerala during an anti-piracy mission last year. 
     The Supreme Court said Mancini had "automatically lost" his
diplomatic immunity by signing a guarantee that the marines,
Massimilano Latorre and Salvatore Girone, would return after
being allowed to come home last month to vote in Italy's general
election.      The Italian government recently said the marines, who face
charges of homicide, will not return, sparking a furious
reaction from New Delhi.      Rome has always denied that India has jurisdiction over the
matter, as the incident took place in international waters.      Italian Foreign Minister Giulio Terzi said last week that
the decision to not return the pair was legitimate and Italy had
a strong case which it wanted to put to independent arbitration.      An earlier deal, which allowed the marines to return to
Italy for Christmas, was respected by both governments and was
seen as a positive step - as well as a sign of goodwill -
towards a diplomatic solution.  
     On Monday the India Supreme Court adjourned Mancini's case
until April 2 and said he was not to leave the country before
then.
