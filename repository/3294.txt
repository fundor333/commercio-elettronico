#titolo Banco Popolare reports net consolidated loss of 945 million - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Milan, March 15 - The northern Italian lender Banco
Popolare reported on Friday a net consolidated loss of 945
million euros in 2012, clobbered by a lackluster joint venture
and corrections made by Italian supervisory authority to its bad
loans total. 
      Banco Popolare's stake in the consumer credit
joint-venture Agos-Ducato - which is controlled by French lender
Credit Agricole - chalked up 516 million euros of losses on
Banco Popolare's books, 400 million of which landed in the
fourth quarter.      In addition, 683.5 million euros' worth of loan-loss
provisions - an allowance for bad loans - were posted in the
last quarter, raising the total to 1.284 billion for the year -
a number that increased thanks to Italy's watchdog central bank,
which advised Banco Popolare to adjust its books after taking a
look at them in recent inspections of a sampling of banks.      Banco Popolare said its "net result, excluding (rating
variations)" was a loss of 627 million euros, and its
"'normalized' net income" for the year added up to 145 million
euros.
