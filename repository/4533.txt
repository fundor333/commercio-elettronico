#titolo Nationwide performance-enhancing drug ring busted - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Rome, March 15 - Nationwide probes into
performance-enhancing drugs in gyms, sporting supplies stores
and non-professional cycling circuits in Italy led to charges
for three people on Friday for alleged illegal steroid use and
distribution.       Investigators from the Marche city of Ancona who lead the
probes said that steroid-based pharmaceuticals including
nandrolone, growth hormones, boldenone and testosterone were
being ordered by Internet mostly from Greece, Ukraine and
Moldova and sold to gym goers and amateur athletes.       Vials and tablets worth 11,500 euros were confiscated and
a pharmacist is among those being probed, investigators said.
