#titolo Anonymous hackers bring down extreme-right website in Italy - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Rome, March 12 - Italians from the international
hacker collective Anonymous have brought down the site of the
extreme-right group CasaPound, calling on the government to
break up the group completely.      "It must be closed, in the name of the Constitution," said
an online petition directed at President Giorgio Napolitano,
accusing the group of "Fascism and Nazism". 
     CasaPound, which has been linked to many armed and bloody
confrontations with leftists and minorities in recent years, 
campaigned for seats in parliament in national elections last
month but was unsuccessful. 
     The Italian Constitution forbids the formation of a Fascist
party.
