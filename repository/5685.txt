#titolo Ex-PD Senator arrested in Puglia 'health scam' - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Bari, March 15 - A former Senator in the centre-left
Democratic Party (PD), Alberto Tedesco, was arrested Friday over
a suspected Puglia healthcare scam after his parliamentary
immunity elapsed with the opening of the new legislature in
Rome.     Tedesco, a former health councillor in the southeastern
Italian region, was placed under house arrest.     He is suspected of conspiracy, corruption, embezzlement,
fraud and contract-rigging, police said.     Puglia Governor Nichi Vendola, leader of the leftwing SEL
party and a key PD ally, was cleared in the case last month.
