#titolo EU must learn from Italy's election, says Hollande - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Brussels, March 15 - French President Francois
Hollande said at the European Union summit on Friday that the
bloc had to learn the lesson from Italy's post-election impasse
and be more flexible with its demands for fiscal consolidation.      Outgoing Premier Mario Monti sent a letter to European
leaders at the summit saying that Italy should be able to use
"every possible ulterior margin" within the European Stability
Pact to be able to boost growth and employment.      Monti's emergency administration implemented austerity
measures to comply with European budget commitments but these
policies deepened Italy's recession and caused unemployment to
rise above 11%.      The approach seemed to be rejected by Italian voters in
last month's election.      Pier Luigi Bersani's centre-left alliance came first in the
elections, but failed to win a working majority in the Senate
because of votes pulled in by three-time premier Silvio
Berlusconi's centre right and Beppe Grillo's anti-establishment
5-Star Movement (M5S). 
     Both Berlusconi and comedian-turned-politician Grillo were
accused of using Euroskeptic, populist rhetoric in the election
campaign.      Monti's reform platform backed by centrist parties,
meanwhile, did less well than expected.      "When consolidation takes place too fast, the risk is that
Europe gets rejected," Hollande said Friday when asked about
Monti's letter. 
     "This is the lesson the absolutely must be learned".      Monti did not attend that second day of what is almost
certainly his last EU summit as premier because he returned to
Rome for the opening sessions of the new term of parliament.
