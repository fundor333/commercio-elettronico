#titolo Benedict XVI following conclave closely from Castel Gandolfo - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Vatican City, March 13 - Benedict XVI is following
the conclave from the pontifical summer residence at Castel
Gandolfo outside Rome, but will not attend his successor's
inaugural mass, the Vatican said Wednesday.      "The pope emeritus is following events closely and with
great spiritual participation," Vatican Spokesman Federico
Lombardi told reporters. 
     The inaugural mass could be held March 19, the day of Saint
Joseph, patron saint of the church, Lombardi added.      "As far as we know, Benedict will not attend," said
Lombardi.      Benedict's secretary, Monsignor Georg Gaenswein, is in the
Vatican, where he will remain for the duration of the conclave. 
     Gaenswein will then ask the new pope for his decision as to
his own future.
