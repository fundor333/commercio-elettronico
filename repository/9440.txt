#titolo Religious icon sellers rest hopes on foreign pope - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Vatican City, March 12 - Religious souvenir sellers
in and around the Vatican are hoping for the election of a
non-Italian and non-European pope as successor to Benedict XVI
on grounds that this would improve sales.      Business has been down over the last few days as the
faithful and tourists are waiting to find out who will be the
next pope before making purchases, they said.      New souvenirs - rosaries, medals, key rings, candles and
other religious items - carrying the image of the new pope
should be available within a maximum of 48 hours from his
election at the conclave starting Tuesday afternoon. 
     Printed souvenirs such as calendars could take a few more
days to arrive due to the greater length of the printing
process.  
     Over and above the provenance of the next pope, the
souvenir sellers hope he is similar in character to the late
John Paul II, Benedict XVI's predecessor, whose image remains
the most popular in terms of demand.  
     However they admit Benedict XVI has made a "slight
comeback" in sales since his shock abdication due to diminishing
physical and mental strength at the end of last month.
