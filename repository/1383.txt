#titolo Interest on one-year Italian bonds rises at auction - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Rome, March 12 - The interest rate on one-year
Italian bonds rose significantly at a Treasury auction on
Tuesday.      The average interest rate set on the one-year BOT bonds was
1.280%, up from 1.094% at the last equivalent sale in February.      Pressure on Italy's borrowing costs has increased since
last month's general election failed to produce a clear winner,
provoking investor fears that the country faces a lengthy period
of political deadlock.
