#titolo Berlusconi sex-trial adjourned until Monday - ANSA English
(see related story)     (ANSA) - Milan, March 13 - A Milan court on Wednesday adjourned the trial into accusations Silvio Berlusconi paid for sex with an underage prostitute until Monday because of the hospitalised ex-premier's health problems. 
Berlusconi has been in Milan's San Raffaele hospital since Friday with an eye problem and blood-pressure fluctuations linked to his treatment. 
The judges decided to adjourn proceedings after receiving a medical certificate from Berlusconi's doctors. 
The court also said the successive hearings in the trial will take place on March 20, 21, 25.       Hospital sources told ANSA that the 76-year-old media magnate would stay in hospital again on Wednesday night.
