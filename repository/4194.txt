#titolo Italy last in productivity growth for big 4, Draghi shows EC - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Rome, March 15 - Italy ranked at the bottom among
the eurozone's major economies in terms of productivity growth,
European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi revealed to the
European Council on Friday.      Graphics in an appendix to Draghi's presentation put Italy
behind Germany, France and Spain in terms of productivity
growth, but on par with them in terms of salary growth.      Draghi also showed a slide illustrating that businesses in
Italy and Spain have suffered the biggest credit squeeze of the
four big economies since 2010. 
     Business loans fell 8% and 3% in Spain and Italy,
respectively, whereas credit continued to grow in France and
Germany.
