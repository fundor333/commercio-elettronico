#titolo Soccer: Juventus draw Bayern Munich in Champions League - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Rome, March 15 - Juventus face a tough challenge in
the Champions League quarter-finals after being pitched against
Bayern Munich in the quarter-finals in Friday's draw in Nyon,
Switzerland.      The German giants, who lost to Chelsea in last season's
final and knocked out Arsenal in the last 16, look sure to cause
more problems than Glasgow side Celtic, who Juve turfed out 5-0
on aggregate in the previous round.
