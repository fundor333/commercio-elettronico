#titolo Just 8% of Italian school children return home on their own - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Rome, March 13 - Only 8% of Italian school children
return home on their own, compared to 76% and 25% of their
German and British counterparts, respectively, Italy's national
research council (CNR) revealed on Wednesday.      Italian children's already limited freedom of movement
continued to shrink in recent years, dealing a significant blow
to their psycho-physical development, concluded CNR in a study
promoted by London's Policy Studies Institute with the
collaboration of Germany and 15 other countries. 
     "Children's freedom of movement has gone from 11% in 2002
to 7% in 2010," said Antonella Prisco, a researcher at CNR's
Institute of Cognition Science and Technology (ISTC-CNR).      Meanwhile, young children's use of public transport is low
in all three countries: 3% for Italy, 3% for Britain and 8% for
Germany.      However, by secondary school the percentage of children
taking public transport leaps to 25% in Britain and 64% in
Germany, whereas in Italy it remains 3%.      Italian boys are more autonomous than Italian girls,
researchers found.      "The possibility for children to move autonomously permits
a fundamental play experience, helps prevent obesity and excess
weight, helps them acquire confidence, self-esteem and the
capacity to interact, reinforces ties with people who live in
their own neighborhood, develops a sense of identity and
responsibility, and reduces the sense of loneliness during
adolescence," Prisco said.
