     (ANSA) - New York, March 15 - United Nations Secretary
General Ban Ki-moon on Friday called for a "peaceful resolution
and respect for international law" in the dispute over two
Italian marines accused of killing two Indian fisherman last
year off the coast of Kerala.      The Italian anti-piracy sharpshooters are charged with
shooting and killing on February 15 last year Indian fishermen
Jelestine Valentine and Ajesh Binki from the oil tanker Enrica
Lexie, which they were guarding.       A diplomatic row between Rome and New Delhi has
intensified after Italy's decision not to send them back after a
trip home to vote in February's general election.
