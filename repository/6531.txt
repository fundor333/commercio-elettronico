#titolo F1: Ferrari duo 6th and 8th in Australian practice - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Rome, March 15 - Ferrari duo Fernando Alonso and
Felipe Massa notched the sixth- and eighth-fastest times
respectively in Friday's practice sessions ahead of the
season-opening Australian Grand Prix on Sunday.      Red Bull's German driver Sebastian Vettel, who is bidding
for his fourth consecutive world title this year, notched the
fastest time on the Melbourne street circuit. 
     "Overall, this was a very productive Friday, as we did a
lot of laps and got through an important initial analysis of the
behaviour of the two types of Pirelli tyres available for this
race," said Spain's two-time world champion Alonso, who finished
second to Vettel last season.      "Our efforts were helped by particularly favourable weather
with sunshine and summery temperatures.      "However, the weather is expected to change completely from
tomorrow, with wind, rain and a significant drop in temperature,
which could influence Sunday's race. 
     "I'm not expecting any major surprises here, we already
knew we were not the quickest and that was confirmed today. 
     "The car responds well, but we know there is still much to
do if we want to fight with the very best".
