#titolo Grillo raps Napolitano for not slamming PdL anti-judge demo - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Rome, March 13 - Beppe Grillo knocked Italian
President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday for not coming out
more forcefully against parliamentarians from Silvio
Berlusconi's People of Freedom (PdL) party who demonstrated
inside Milan's main courthouse on Monday.     PdL parliamentarians, led by party secretary Angelino
Alfano, railed against a series of criminal proceedings against
Berlusconi, accusing judges of politically motivated persecution
and threatening to boycott the opening session of parliament. 
     "(It's a) poor country where a president of the republic,
instead of going on prime-time television to condemn a
subversive act of exceptional magnitude like the sad parade of
parliamentarians in the court, receives Alfano (ex-justice
minister) at the Quirinale the day after," wrote the leader of
the populist and anti-establishment 5-Star Movement (M5S) in his
blog, making reference to Alfano's Tuesday visit to the Italian
president's official residence. 
     Napolitano on Tuesday attempted to bring some calm back to
the country's political scene by conducting separate talks with
Alfano and later with members of the Italian judges'
self-regulatory body. 
     Napolitano then released a note in which he warned against
"destabilising tensions" which could harm Italy's
democracy.      Responding to criticisms of Italy's judiciary by PdL
leaders, Napolitano said that the idea of judicial maneuvers
aimed at preventing Berlusconi from participating in the coming
institutional appointments were an "aberrant hypothesis".      The president, however, also warned the judges to not
overreach their mandates.
