#titolo Man snips hair on bus, confesses 'burning desire' - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Bologna, March 12 - A 40-year-old man cited by
Bologna police on Tuesday after being caught with hair he had
cut from unsuspecting young women's heads on public
transportation said he was driven by "a burning desire".       The man, originally from the southern city of Bari, raised
the suspicion of a police unit patrolling for pick-pockets when
he was seen getting off and on a bus repeatedly in the area of a
cosmetics convention in the city's trade center.       When stopped and searched by police, he was found with
hairdresser's scissors and locks he had snipped from several
female passengers.       The fetishist faces charges of violence and illegal
possession of scissors.
