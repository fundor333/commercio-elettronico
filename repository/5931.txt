#titolo EU hopes for 'common resolution' in India-Italy marines case - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Brussels, March 15 - The European Union on Friday
said it hoped for a "common solution" to the dispute between
India and Italy over Rome's decision not to return two marines
for trial on murder charges.      "The EU is taking note of the disputes between India and
Italy and continues to hope that a common solution can be
reached through negotiation," said a spokesperson for Catherine
Ashton, EU foreign affairs representative. 
     On Thursday India's Supreme Court slapped a travel ban on
Italian ambassador to New Delhi, Daniele Mancini, until March 19
after Rome said it would not return Massimilano Latorre and
Salvatore Girone for trial following the expiry of a four-week
permit issued to the pair to allow them to return home to take
part in February's elections. 
     The marines face charges of homicide in India after
allegedly shooting and killing two Indian fisherman, Jelestine
Valentine and Ajesh Binki, during an anti-piracy mission in
February 2012. 
     The Italian government has always denied that India has
jurisdiction over the matter, as the incident took place in
international waters off the Kerala coast.      In its letter to the Italian ambassador, the Indian Supreme
Court said Mancini "violated" a "sworn declaration" presented on
February 9 to the Indian government as "a guarantee of the
marines' return".      Along with the order not to leave the country, the Supreme
Court ordered the ambassador to offer explanations for Italy's
actions by March 18.      Italy has expressed its openness to a third-party
arbitrator in the dispute.
