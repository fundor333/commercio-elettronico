#titolo More than 1 mln expected for pope's inaugural Mass - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Rome, March 15 - More than one million people are
expected to turn up for Pope Francis's inaugural Mass in St
Peter's Tuesday, Rome Prefect Giuseppe Pecoraro said Friday.    Pecoraro said public-order and security measures would cope
with the influx, expected to match that for John Paul II in
1978.    Argentine Francis, the first non-European pope for 1,300
years, was elected Wednesday after last month's shock
resignation of Benedict XVI.
