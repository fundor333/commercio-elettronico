#titolo Topless feminist arrested outside Vatican during conclave - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Vatican City, March 12 - A protester from the
Ukraine-based feminist group FEMEN was detained by police for
demonstrating topless in St Peter's Square outside the Vatican
on Tuesday at the start of the conclave to elect a new pope. 
     "Pope no more!" she shouted as police carried her away. 
     Last month, shortly after Benedict XVI announced he would
become the first pope in 600 years to abdicate, eight
bare-chested members of the group stormed the Notre Dame
cathedral in Paris to "celebrate the pope's farewell", according
to French media.
