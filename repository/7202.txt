#titolo India's Supreme Court says Italian ambassador can't leave - ANSA English
(ANSA) - New Delhi, March 14 - India's Supreme Court on Thursday wrote to the Italian ambassador to New Delhi, Daniele Mancini, telling him ''not to leave the country'' following the Italian government's recent decision not to return two marines accused of killing two Indian fishermen. 
The marines were held in India until February, when they were allowed to return to Italy to vote in last month's general election.          A diplomatic source at the Italian embassy told ANSA that ''we are aware of the developments, but we haven't yet received any official communication''.
