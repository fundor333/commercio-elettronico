#titolo Snow, rain and wind pummel Italy - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Turin, March 18 - Winter refused to give way to
spring in Italy as snow and rain pummeled much of the peninsula
on Monday.  
     In the northern Piedmont region, snow fell for 36 hours
straight, while the region's Moro Pass saw record snowfall of 80
cm.      Italian mountain ski resorts - plagued by higher than usual
temperatures and lack of snow earlier this winter - are seeing a
late season reprieve. 
     Nearly a metre of snow has fallen on the upscale resort
Courmayeur, on the southern side of Mont Blanc, since Saturday
night. 
     Meanwhile, nearly a half-metre of snow has also blanketed
valleys of Italy's northwestern Liguria region, while trains
were suspended from the coastal line running from Cinque Terre
to La Spezia due to abundant rain flooding the Biassa tunnel.      Traffic snarled on freeways east and west of Milan - to
Bologna and Genoa, respectively - as heavy wet snow alternated
with freezing rain.      Central and southern Italy were hardly spared, as fierce
winds blew down tree limbs and billboards in many areas of Rome,
and suspended ferry connections between Naples and Capri.      Wind and rain also pelted Italy's toe in the region of
Calabria, where tourists flocked to southern ski facilities in
the mountainous Sila national park.
