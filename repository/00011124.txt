#titolo Vatican election faster than us say Italian and US officials - ANSA English
(ANSA) - New York, March 18 - The Vatican's fast election of Pope Francis contrasted with slow-moving Italian and American political machinery, US President Giorgio Napolitano and visiting US Vice-President Joe Biden agreed Monday. 
Biden remarked to Napolitano that it took just 24 hours for the famous white smoke to gush out of the Sistine Chapel, while US elections drag on for years. 
"They were faster than us Italians," shot back Napolitano, who is struggling to find a way forward after Italy's inconclusive general election three weeks ago. 
"They were faster than American politicians too," Biden said. 
  Biden, a practising Catholic, will represent the United States at Francis's inaugural Mass on Tuesday.
