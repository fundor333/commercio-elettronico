    (ANSA) - New Delhi, March 15 - Sources from the foreign
ministry in India told ANSA Friday that Italians may find it
harder to get a visa due to Italy's refusal to send back two
anti-piracy marines accused of murdering two Indian fishermen
last year.      "There will inevitably be repercussions on bilateral
relations," said a high-ranking source who asked to remain
anonymous, adding that visa restrictions for Italians could be
among them.
