     (ANSA) - Vatican City, March 13 - Buenos Aires Archbishop
Jorge Mario Borgoglio was elected pope Wednesday. 
     Borgoglio, 76, is the first Jesuit pope. 
     A conservative like his predecessor Benedict XVI and a
strong supporter of helping the poor, he will become Pope
Francis I. 
     In his first words on the balcony of St Peter's, he said
the cardinals who elected him had chosen someone "from the end
of the Earth".      One of five children, he is the son of a railway worker and
his wife. 
     Borgoglio has so far lived in a modest flat and cooked his
own meals. 
     He is the 266th pope and leader of the world's 1.2 billion
Catholics.      Borgoglio, whose great-grandfather was from the northern
Italian region of Piedmont, is believed to be close to the
Communion and Liberation movement, a doctrinally conservative
group founded in the 1960s partly in response to Marxism and
other leftist movements. 
     His predecessors Benedict XVI and John Paul II were
supporters of the movement. 
     While he is not known to spend much time preaching about
helping the impoverished, some of his actions stand out. 
     Upon being named a cardinal in 2001, he encouraged people
not to spend money to celebrate with him in Rome and instead to
donate the funds to the poor.
