#titolo Bank of Italy tells loss-making banks to not pay dividends - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Rome, March 14 - Italy's central bank on Thursday
asked Italian banks with balance sheets in the red for 2012 not
to pay bonuses to managers or dividends.      In a statement, the Bank of Italy said that banks should
not only eliminate bonuses to chief executives if 2012 results
are loss-making but that they should also reduce bonuses to
other employees.      The bank added that banks should not try to find other
methods to "get around" the requested bonus-ban by using, for
instance, salary increases or increases in variable compensation
for future years.
