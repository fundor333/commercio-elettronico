#titolo Papal Twitter account reactivated after Francis's election - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Vatican City, March 13 - The papal Twitter account,
@Pontifex, was reactivated after Francis I was elected pope on
Wednesday.      "HABEMUS PAPAM FRANCISCUM," was the first tweet that was
posted after the Argentine pontiff was presented in St Peter's
Square.      The account had been frozen since Benedict XVI stepped down
as pope on February 28.
