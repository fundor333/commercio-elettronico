     (ANSA) - New York, March 13 - United States President Barack
Obama said Wednesday that he was looking forward to working with
the newly elected Pope Francis I.      "On behalf of the American people, Michelle and I offer our
warm wishes to His Holiness Pope Francis as he ascends to the
Chair of Saint Peter and begins his papacy," Obama said in a
statement.      "As a champion of the poor and the most vulnerable among
us, he carries forth the message of love and compassion that has
inspired the world for more than 2,000 years - that in each
other we see the face of God. 
     "As the first pope from the Americas, his selection also
speaks to the strength and vitality of a region that is
increasingly shaping our world, and alongside millions of
Hispanic Americans, those of us in the United States share the
joy of this historic day. 
     "Just as I appreciated our work with Pope Benedict XVI, I
look forward to working with His Holiness to advance peace,
security and dignity for our fellow human beings, regardless of
their faith. 
     "We join with people around the world in offering our
prayers for the Holy Father as he begins the sacred work of
leading the Catholic Church in our modern world".
