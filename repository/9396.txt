#titolo Berlusconi party MP should turn self in, go to jail Friday - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Caserta, March 12 - Nicola Cosentino, a Mob-linked
MP for ex-premier Silvio Berlusconi's People of Freedom (PdL)
party, should turn himself in and go to jail on Friday, his
lawyer Stefano Montone told ANSA on Tuesday.      Cosentino is currently free as parliament voted not to
ratify two arrest warrants relating to accusations of corruption
and collusion with the Casalesi clan of the Neapolitan mafia,
the Camorra.      But his privileges as a lawmaker will end on Friday when
the new term of parliament starts after the PdL did not include
him on its list of candidates for last month's general election.      Cosentino, a former industry undersecretary, had two recent
petitions for the arrest warrants to be revoked turned down by
courts.        
     He is accused of corruption, re-using illicit capital and
allegedly helping the Casalesis invest in a shopping mall near
Caserta northwest of Naples.      Berlusconi said in the run-up to the election that he
"regretfully" was forced to drop Cosentino, who is a PdL
heavyweight in the Campania region around Naples and a former
party leader there.      Prosecutors have alleged that Cosentino was the "national
reference point" of the Casalesis, who come from the Campania
town he was born in, Casal di Principe.      Cosentino denies wrongdoing and Berlusconi has described
the case against him as an example of alleged judicial
persecution.      The Casalesis are the Camorra clan whose death threats have
forced anti-mafia writer Roberto Saviano, author of the 2006
bestseller Gomorrah, into round-the-clock police protection.
