#titolo Pensioner becomes drug mule to boost pension - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Genoa, March 12 - A 73-year-old former mechanic
arrested by Genoa police on Tuesday for international drug
trafficking said that he needed the activity as a supplement to
his insufficient pension payments so that he could make ends
meet. 
     Celestino Del Fossa, originally from a small town near
Verona and formerly a maintenance man at the Grand Hotel in
Malaga, became a drug mule between Barcelona, Tangier and Genoa,
transporting hashish and cocaine by public ferry.       Del Fossa was stopped in the Genoa port with over 70
kilograms of hashish and eight kilograms of cocaine worth
approximately one million euros hidden inside 27 plastic bottles
and destined for the market in northern Italy.
