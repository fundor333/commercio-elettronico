#titolo Italian Muslim community welcomes new pope - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Rome, March 15 - The Italian Muslim community on
Friday issued a statement wishing "blessings and peace" upon
newly elected Pope Francis. 
     "As Muslims, we wish to express to all Catholics, our
brothers in the faith of the One God, our most heartfelt wishes
for the new leadership of the Catholic Church," said the Italian
Islamic Religious Community COREIS. 
     The group said it hoped for "true harmony" between
Catholics and Muslims, and prayed that the new pontificate would
be in line with "a universal recognition of all orthodoxies
founded in the belief of the One God". 
     The statement recalled the "historic meeting" between
Shaykh Abd al-Wahid Pallavicini, in charge of interfaith
dialogue at Rome's mosque, and John Paul II in Assisi in 1986.
