#titolo Cameron 'respectfully' disagrees with pope's Falkland stance - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Brussels, March 15 - British Prime Minister David
Cameron said on Friday that he "respectfully" doesn't agree with
the newly elected pontiff's previous comments about the Falkland
Islands.       Pope Francis has been quoted as describing the Falkland
Islands as Argentine soil that was "usurped" by Britain.       In a recent referendum, Falkland islanders overwhelmingly
voted to remain an overseas British territory.       "The Falkland Islanders have spoken so clearly about their
future, and now other countries right across the world, I hope,
will respect and revere this very, very clear result," Cameron
said on Tuesday.       Argentina occupied the islands, which it calls Las
Malvinas, in 1982 but Britain retook them after a brief but
fierce war.
