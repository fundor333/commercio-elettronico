    (ANSA) - Rome, March 13 - Rome Mayor Gianni Alemanno gave a
warm welcome to Pope Francis I after his election on Wednesday.      The Argentine also becomes the new bishop of Rome.      "A warm welcome to the new pontiff Jorge Mario Bergoglio,"
said Alemanno on his Twitter account. 
     Italian President Giorgio Napolitano was moved by the
simplicity of Francis's first comments as pope, ANSA sources
said.      The official twitter account of the British Embassy to the
Holy See also wished Francis well.      "The British Embassy to the Holy See joins the Prime
Minister @Number10gov in welcoming the election of His Holiness
Pope Francis I," it said via Twitter.      Britain is engaged in a sovereignty dispute with Francis's
homeland over the Falkland Islands. The two nations fought a war
over the islands in 1982.
