#titolo Milan stock market closes down 0,82% - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Milan, March 11 - The Milan stock exchange closed
down 0,82% Monday in spite of the limited reaction to Fitch's
downgrading last Friday, infecting Madrid which lost 0,95%.     
     Concerns over Italy, as well as weak economic data from
China, toned down the optimism generated last week across Europe
by US payroll data.  
     Late on Friday, Fitch downgraded Italy's debt to BBB-plus
from A-minus. 
     The spread between 10-year Italian bonds and safer German
bonds increased to 320 basis points.      The Paris Cac 40 index fell by 0,10% to 3.836, 27 points
while in Frankfurt the Dax exchange lost -0,03% to 7,984,29
points.      London defied the European trend. 
     The FTSE-100 went up 0,31% to 6.503, 63 points.
