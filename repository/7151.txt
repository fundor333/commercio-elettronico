#titolo Grillo slams party politics on German TV - ANSA English
     (ANSA) - Berlin, March 15 - Beppe Grillo, leader of the
anti-establishment 5-Star Movement (M5S), on Friday accused
Italy's political parties of wrecking the country in an
interview with German TV.      ''Economically and morally Italy is a pile of rubble,'' the
gadfly comedian told Germany's principal state channel ARD. 
     ''Italians turned their backs on political parties because
they have destroyed and drained our country,'' Grillo continued.      His M5S took an unexpected 162 seats in recent
parliamentary elections in what was widely seen as a protest
vote by a disaffected electorate. 
     Grillo added that ''for years'' parties on both left and
right have been acting ''only in their own interest''.      ''The European dream will dissolve because the economy is
not moving any more,'' he concluded. 
     So far M5S has ruled out any form of alliance with the
centre-left coalition led by Democratic Party (Pd) secretary
Pier Luigi Bersani, which polled most votes in the February
elections but failed to win a working majority in both houses of
parliament, leading to political deadlock.
