#titolo U.S. Ambassador to Italy praises 5-Star Movement as example to follow - ANSA English
(ANSA) - Rome, March 13 - US Ambassador to Italy David Thorne called on young Italians to rise up and change their country - like the 5-Star Movement - at a Roman high school on Wednesday. 
"It is now up to you to act on behalf of your country, an extremely important country in the world," Thorne told students in Italian on career day at the Visconti high school in Rome. 
"I know there are problems and challenges in this moment, problems with meritocracy, but you can take your country in hand and act, like the 5-Star Movement, for reform and change. I hope that many of you will make a positive contribution in this sense for your country".
