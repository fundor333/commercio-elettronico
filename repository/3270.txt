#titolo Pope says Church 'an NGO' without the Lord in first mass - ANSA English
(ANSA) - Vatican City, March 14 - Pope Francis celebrated his first mass on Thursday inside the Sistine Chapel with the College of Cardinals.     
 In his homily, Francis said that the Church risked "becoming a pious non-governmental organization" if "we don't confess to Jesus Christ".   
 Citing passages from the Psalms, the Gospel of St Matthew, and the Letter of St Peter, the pope's message focused on the theme of movement as essential to the Church staying vibrant. 
 "We walk in the light of the Lord. Our lives are a journey - when we stop, there is something wrong".  
 The first prayer of the mass was a blessing for the Argentine pontiff and his predecessor Benedict XVI. 
 It was followed by a call for the leaders of nations "not to lord over people".  
 At the end of the mass, a prayer was said for "those who are suffering, the struggling and forlorn".
